https://sifted.eu/articles/ai-girlfriends	This AI girlfriend startup is making $100k a month fulfilling people’s fetishes	t was never going to take long for some dudes to recognise that AI could be used to generate not only fake Drake songs and images of a high-fashion pope — but also girlfriends, fine tuned to avoid all the pesky challenges that come with a real-life partner.    It was also just a matter of time before someone turned that idea into a business.  And so, a year on from its release, image generation tool Stable Diffusion is being put to work by Romania-headquartered startup DreamGF to help its customers find the AI-generated girl of their dreams.  The company says it has thousands of users signing up every day — and has already hit profitability.  But, like many startups working in the adult market, DreamGF is running into problems with payment providers, while some say that creating legions of compliant AI-powered girlfriends is reinforcing damaging attitudes towards women.  The male gAIze A visit to DreamGF’s website isn’t a good idea while you’re in the office. You’re met by a host of scantily clad, AI-generated women who, the website promises, will share “Personalized Content On-Demand… that Exceeds Your Wildest Desires”.  Creating a “girlfriend” is like making a Sim, but much more X-rated. Clothing options cover various stereotypes, ranging from “maid” to “cheerleader”, while the choice of “characters” include “casual”, “submissive”, “nympho” and — confusingly — “nurse”.  The range of clothing options on DreamGF The range of clothing options on DreamGF DreamGF CEO Georgi Dimitrov says that the reason these options more closely resemble porn genres than character traits is that they’re largely dictated by paying customers.  “We spend a lot of time reflecting on what the paid users want. When they request something, we tend to add it,” he says. “That’s why the nurse or dominatrix professions are there.”  3x a week  ~/ The Sifted Newsletter Setting the agenda for startup Europe and telling you why it matters.  By Sifted journalists  Sign up Once created, users can chat to their new partner and ask them to send photos (which can be nude). Dimitrov says that you can ask your AI girlfriend to indulge pretty much anything that comes to mind, with the exception of illegal practices, such as child sexual abuse.  When asked whether turning women into a customisable product — that can be made submissive or nymphomaniacal at the users’ whim — might be contributing to unhealthy attitudes in men, Dimitrov says it’s better that these attitudes are taken out on AI rather than real people.  “People want to get their fetishes out and they will pay for services to do that. I believe that it’s better they do this with an AI chatbot, which doesn’t have feelings and doesn’t get hurt, rather than doing it to real girls,” he says.  Bringing AI girlfriends to life Dimitrov says he got the idea for the company while working at an agency for creators on the adult content-streaming platform OnlyFans, where he saw that new AI tools like ChatGPT could be used to recreate the text-based chats that users pay for from real-life models.  “I saw a big potential for building something in the ‘not safe for work’ industry… I know the adult business and how things work,” he tells Sifted. “We saw a very big niche with AI for ‘sexting’ and image generation.”  Dimitrov says that when he launched a beta version of the product in May, it quickly became clear that there was demand.  “When we launched it, we saw thousands of people registering and using the products,” he says. “It was a proof of concept and we are now sorting out our company structure.”  Today, Dimitrov says that the company has 500k registered users and 10k paying customers, bringing in “around $120k” a month, making the company profitable just three months after officially launching.   “We had a very big offer from a well-known investment firm in Bulgaria that we recently rejected because we are growing so fast. We don’t even think that we need investors to push the product,” he tells Sifted.  What’s next? DreamGF subscriptions range from €10 to €97 per month, with higher tiers offering more perks: customers paying the big bucks get sent more nude photos from their “girlfriends” and are able to have more than one. Dimitrov says his company is now working on an AI boyfriend product, which will be marketed at both men and women.  Currently, all of DreamGF’s payments go through third-party subscription platform Patreon. Dimitrov explains that it’s been a struggle to set up an internal payment system for the startup, as many providers — such as Paypal and Stripe — strictly won’t work with companies in the adult industry.  “It’s not ideal because people need to register on our platform first, then register on Patreon and connect their profiles. It’s a big hassle currently,” he says.  DreamGF is hoping to resolve this soon with its own payments system and also says it’s working on partnerships with real-life OnlyFans models, who’d be able to license out their appearance and personality, to be turned into an AI girlfriend.  “They will take between 30-50% of the revenue, depending on how famous they are,” says Dimitrov.  But even as real-life humans start to make their way into the strange emerging world of AI companionship, DreamGF still feels like a surreal moment for humanity — as intimacy is automated and romantic desire is replaced by transactional demand.

Scam artists are now using the technology to clone voices, including those of friends and family.  The disturbing trend is adding to mounting losses due to fraud. Americans lost nearly $9 billion to fraud last year alone – an increase of over 150% in just two years, according to the Federal Trade Commission.   The AI scam, which uses computer-generated voice, has left a trail of emotional devastation. Jennifer DeStefano, a mother, recounted during a U.S. Senate meeting her terrifying encounter with scammers who used the voice of her 15-year-old daughter, claiming they had her.   ""Mom, these bad men have me. Help me, help me, help me,"" DeStefano said she was told over the phone.   But her daughter was safe in her bed.   Kathy Stokes, the AARP director of fraud prevention, said younger people actually experience fraud and financial loss more often than older people, but it's the older generation who often have so much to lose.  Pete Nicoletti, a cyber security expert at Check Point Software Technologies, said common software can recreate a person's voice after just 10 minutes of learning it.   To protect against voice cloning scams, Nicoletti recommends families adopt a ""code word"" system and always call a person back to verify the authenticity of the call. Additionally, he advises setting social media accounts to private, as publicly available information can be easily used against individuals."
https://www.apa.org/monitor/2023/07/psychology-embracing-ai	AI is changing every aspect of psychology. Here’s what to watch for	In psychology practice, artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots can make therapy more accessible and less expensive. AI tools can also improve interventions, automate administrative tasks, and aid in training new clinicians. On the research side, synthetic intelligence is offering new ways to understand human intelligence, while machine learning allows researchers to glean insights from massive quantities of data. Meanwhile, educators are exploring ways to leverage ChatGPT in the classroom.  “A lot of people get resistant, but this is something we can’t control. It’s happening whether we want it to or not,” said Jessica Jackson, PhD, a licensed psychologist and equitable technology advocate based in Texas. “If we’re thoughtful and strategic about how we integrate AI, we can have a real impact on lives around the world.”  [Related: How to use ChatGPT as a learning tool]  Despite AI’s potential, there is still cause for concern. AI tools used in health care have discriminated against people based on their race and disability status (Grant, C., ACLU News and Commentary, October 3, 2022). Rogue chatbots have spread misinformation, professed their love to users, and sexually harassed minors, which prompted leaders in tech and science to call for a pause to AI research in March 2023.  “A lot of what’s driving progress is the capacities these systems have—and that’s outstripping how well we understand how they work,” said Tom Griffiths, PhD, a professor of psychology and computer science who directs the Computational Cognitive Science Lab at Princeton University. “What makes sense now is to make a big parallel investment in understanding these systems,” something psychologists are well positioned to help do.   Uncovering bias As algorithms and chatbots flood the system, a few crucial questions have emerged. Is AI safe to use? Is it ethical? What protections could help ensure privacy, transparency, and equity as these tools are increasingly used across society?  Psychologists may be among the most qualified to answer those questions, with training on various research methodologies, ethical treatment of participants, psychological impact, and more.  “One of the unique things psychologists have done throughout our history is to uncover the harm that can come about by things that appear equal or fair,” said Adam Miner, PsyD, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University, citing the amicus brief filed by Kenneth Clark, PhD, and Mamie Phipps Clark, PhD, in Brown v. Board of Education.  [Related: AI in hiring: More research required]  When it comes to AI, psychologists have the expertise to question assumptions about new technology and examine its impact on users. Psychologist Arathi Sethumadhavan, PhD, the former director of AI research for Microsoft’s ethics and society team, has conducted research on DALL-E 2, GPT-3, Bing AI, and others.  Sethumadhavan said psychologists can help companies understand the values, motivations, expectations, and fears of diverse groups that might be impacted by new technologies. They can also help recruit participants with rigor based on factors such as gender, ancestry, age, personality, years of work experience, privacy views, neurodiversity, and more.  With these principles in mind, Sethumadhavan has incorporated the perspectives of different impacted stakeholders to responsibly shape products. For example, for a new text-to-speech feature, she interviewed voice actors and people with speech impediments to understand and address both benefits and harms of the new technology. Her team learned that people with speech impediments were optimistic about using the product to boost their confidence during interviews and even for dating and that synthetic voices with the capability to change over time would better serve children using the service. She has also applied sampling methods used frequently by psychologists to increase the representation of African Americans in speech recognition data sets.  “In addition, it’s important that we bring in the perspectives of people who are peripherally involved in the AI development life cycle,” Sethumadhavan said, including people who contribute data (such as images of their face to train facial recognition systems), moderators who collect data, and enrichment professionals who label data (such as filtering out inappropriate content).  Psychologists are also taking a close look at human-machine interaction to understand how people perceive AI and what ripple effects such perceptions could have across society. One study by psychologist Yochanan Bigman, PhD, an assistant professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, found that people are less morally outraged by gender discrimination caused by an algorithm as opposed to discrimination created by humans (Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, Vol. 152, No. 1, 2023). Study participants also felt that companies held less legal liability for algorithmic discrimination.  In another study, Bigman and his colleagues analyzed interactions at a hotel in Malaysia employing both robot and human workers. After hotel guests interacted with robot workers, they treated human workers with less respect (working paper).  “There was a spillover effect, where suddenly we have these agents that are tools, and that can cause us to view humans as tools, too,” he said.  Many questions remain about what causes people to trust or rely on AI, said Sethumadhavan, and answering them will be crucial in limiting harms, including the spread of misinformation. Regulators are also scrambling to decide how to contain the power of AI and who bears responsibility when something goes wrong, Bigman said.  “If a human discriminates against me, I can sue them,” he said. “If an AI discriminates against me, how easy will it be for me to prove it?”   AI in the clinic Psychology practice is ripe for AI innovations—including therapeutic chatbots, tools that automate notetaking and other administrative tasks, and more intelligent training and interventions—but clinicians need tools they can understand and trust.  While chatbots lack the context, life experience, and verbal nuances of human therapists, they have the potential to fill gaps in mental health service provision.  [Related: Let’s Get Technical reviews of apps and tools for practicing psychologists]  “The bottom line is we don’t have enough providers,” Jackson said. “While therapy should be for everyone, not everyone needs it. The chatbots can fill a need.” For some mental health concerns, such as sleep problems or distress linked to chronic pain, training from a chatbot could suffice.  In addition to making mental health support more affordable and accessible, chatbots can help people who may shy away from a human therapist, such as those new to therapy or people with social anxiety. They also offer the opportunity for the field to reimagine itself, Jackson said—to intentionally build culturally competent AIs that can make psychology more inclusive.  “My concern is that AI won’t be inclusive,” Jackson said. “AI, at the end of the day, has to be trained. Who is programming it?”  Other serious concerns include informed consent and patient privacy. Do users understand how the algorithm works, and what happens to their data? In January, the mental health nonprofit Koko raised eyebrows after it offered counseling to 4,000 people without telling them the support came from ChatGPT-3. Reports have also emerged that getting therapy from generative language models (which produce different text in each interaction, making it difficult to test for clinical validity or safety) has led to suicide and other harms.  But psychology has AI success stories, too. The Wysa chatbot does not use generative AI, but limits interactions to statements drafted or approved by human therapists. Wysa does not collect email addresses, phone numbers, or real names, and it redacts information users share that could help identify them.  The app, which delivers cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety and chronic pain, has received Breakthrough Device Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration. It can be used as a stand-alone tool or integrated into traditional therapy, where clinicians can monitor their patients’ progress between sessions, such as performance on cognitive reframing exercises.  “Wysa is not meant to replace psychologists or human support. It’s a new way to receive support,” said Smriti Joshi, MPhil, the company’s chief psychologist.  AI also has the potential to increase efficiency in the clinic by lowering the burden of administrative tasks. Natural language processing tools such as Eleos can listen to sessions, take notes, and highlight themes and risks for practitioners to review. Other tasks suited to automation include analysis of assessments, tracking of patient symptoms, and practice management.  Before integrating AI tools into their workflow, many clinicians want more information on how patient data are being handled and what apps are safe and ethical to use. The field also needs a better understanding of the error rates and types of errors these tools tend to make, Miner said. That can help ensure these tools do not disenfranchise groups already left out of medical systems, such as people who speak English as a second language or use cultural idioms of distress.  Miner and his colleagues are also using AI to measure what’s working well in therapy sessions and to identify areas for improvement for trainees (npj Mental Health Research, Vol. 1, No. 19, 2022). For example, natural language models could search thousands of hours of therapy sessions and surface missed opportunities to validate a patient or failures to ask key questions, such as whether a suicidal patient has a firearm at home. Training software along these lines, such as Lyssn—which evaluates providers on their adherence to evidence-based protocols—is starting to hit the market.  “To me, that’s where AI really does good work,” Miner said. “Because it doesn’t have to be perfect, and it keeps the human in the driver’s seat.”  Transforming research For researchers, AI is unlocking troves of new data on human behavior—and providing the power to analyze it. Psychologists have long measured behavior through self-reports and lab experiments, but they can now use AI to monitor things like social media activity, credit card spending, GPS data, and smartphone metrics.  “That actually changes a lot, because suddenly we can look at individual differences as they play out in everyday behavior,” said personality psychologist and researcher Sandra Matz, PhD, an associate professor at Columbia Business School.  Matz combines big data on everyday experiences with more traditional methods, such as ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). Combining those data sources can paint a picture of how different people respond to the same situation, and ultimately shape personalized interventions across sectors, for instance in education and health care.  AI also opens up opportunities for passive monitoring that may save lives. Ross Jacobucci, PhD, and Brooke Ammerman, PhD, both assistant professors of psychology at the University of Notre Dame, are testing an algorithm that collects screenshots of patients’ online activity to flag the use or viewing of terms related to suicide and self-harm. By pairing that data with EMAs and physiological metrics from a smart watch, they hope to build a tool that can alert clinicians in real time about patients’ suicide risk.  “The golden goose is passive sensing,” Jacobucci said. “How can that inform, not only who is at risk, but more importantly, when they’re at risk?”  Natural language processing models are also proving useful for researchers. A team at Drexel University in Philadelphia has shown that GPT-3 can predict dementia by analyzing speech patterns (Agbavor, F., & Liang, H., PLOS Digital Health, Vol. 1, No. 12, 2022). Cognitive psychologists are testing GPT’s performance on canonical experiments to learn more about how its reasoning abilities compare to humans (Binz, M., & Schulz, E., PNAS, Vol. 120, No. 6, 2023). Griffiths is using GPT as a tool to understand the limits of human language.  “These models can do a lot of things that are very impressive,” Griffiths said. “But if we want to feel safe in delegating tasks to them, we need to understand more about how they’re representing the world—and how it might differ from the way we think about it—before that turns into a problem.”  With their toolbox for understanding intelligent systems, psychologists are in the perfect position to help. One big question moving forward is how to prepare graduate students to collaborate more effectively with the computer scientists who build AI models.  “People in psychology don’t know the jargon in computer science and vice versa—and there are very few people at the intersection of the two fields,” Jacobucci said.  Ultimately, AI will present challenges for psychologists, but meeting those challenges carries the potential to transform the field.  “AI will never fully replace humans, but it may require us to increase our awareness and educate ourselves about how to leverage it safely,” Joshi said. “If we do that, AI can up the game for psychology in so many ways.”

In this work, we present an approach to evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets with respect to phenotypic subgroups. Using the dermatologist approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classification system, we characterize the gender and skin type distribution of two facial analysis benchmarks, IJB-A and Adience. We find that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects (79.6% for IJB-A and 86.2% for Adience) and introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classification systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassified group (with error rates of up to 34.7%). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8%. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classification systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms. Keywords: Computer Vision, Algorithmic Audit, Gender Classification 1. Introduction Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly infiltrating every aspect of society. From helping determine ∗ Download our gender and skin type balanced PPB dataset at gendershades.org who is hired, fired, granted a loan, or how long an individual spends in prison, decisions that have traditionally been performed by humans are rapidly made by algorithms (O’Neil, 2017; Citron and Pasquale, 2014). Even AI-based technologies that are not specifically trained to perform highstakes tasks (such as determining how long someone spends in prison) can be used in a pipeline that performs such tasks. For example, while face recognition software by itself should not be trained to determine the fate of an individual in the criminal justice system, it is very likely that such software is used to identify suspects. Thus, an error in the output of a face recognition algorithm used as input for other tasks can have serious consequences. For example, someone could be wrongfully accused of a crime based on erroneous but confident misidentification of the perpetrator from security video footage analysis. Many AI systems, e.g. face recognition tools, rely on machine learning algorithms that are trained with labeled data. It has recently been shown that algorithms trained with biased data have resulted in algorithmic discrimination (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Caliskan et al., 2017). Bolukbasi et al. even showed that the popular word embedding space, Word2Vec, encodes societal gender biases. The authors used Word2Vec to train an analogy generator that fills in missing words in analogies. The analogy man is to computer programmer as woman is to “X” was completed with “homemaker”, conforming to the stereotype that programming is associated with men and homemaking with women. The biases in Word2Vec are thus likely to be propagated throughout any system that uses this embedding.  c 2018 J. Buolamwini & T. Gebru. Gender Shades Although many works have studied how to create fairer algorithms, and benchmarked discrimination in various contexts (Kilbertus et al., 2017; Hardt et al., 2016b,a), only a handful of works have done this analysis for computer vision. However, computer vision systems with inferior performance across demographics can have serious implications. Esteva et al. showed that simple convolutional neural networks can be trained to detect melanoma from images, with accuracies as high as experts (Esteva et al., 2017). However, without a dataset that has labels for various skin characteristics such as color, thickness, and the amount of hair, one cannot measure the accuracy of such automated skin cancer detection systems for individuals with different skin types. Similar to the well documented detrimental effects of biased clinical trials (Popejoy and Fullerton, 2016; Melloni et al., 2010), biased samples in AI for health care can result in treatments that do not work well for many segments of the population. In other contexts, a demographic group that is underrepresented in benchmark datasets can nonetheless be subjected to frequent targeting. The use of automated face recognition by law enforcement provides such an example. At least 117 million Americans are included in law enforcement face recognition networks. A yearlong research investigation across 100 police departments revealed that African-American individuals are more likely to be stopped by law enforcement and be subjected to face recognition searches than individuals of other ethnicities (Garvie et al., 2016). False positives and unwarranted searches pose a threat to civil liberties. Some face recognition systems have been shown to misidentify people of color, women, and young people at high rates (Klare et al., 2012). Monitoring phenotypic and demographic accuracy of these systems as well as their use is necessary to protect citizens’ rights and keep vendors and law enforcement accountable to the public. We take a step in this direction by making two contributions. First, our work advances gender classification benchmarking by introducing a new face dataset composed of 1270 unique individuals that is more phenotypically balanced on the basis of skin type than existing benchmarks. To our knowledge this is the first gender classification benchmark labeled by the Fitzpatrick (TB, 1988) six-point skin type scale, allowing us to benchmark the performance of gender classification algorithms by skin type. Second, this work introduces the first intersectional demographic and phenotypic evaluation of face-based gender classification accuracy. Instead of evaluating accuracy by gender or skin type alone, accuracy is also examined on 4 intersectional subgroups: darker females, darker males, lighter females, and lighter males. The 3 evaluated commercial gender classifiers have the lowest accuracy on darker females. Since computer vision technology is being utilized in high-stakes sectors such as healthcare and law enforcement, more work needs to be done in benchmarking vision algorithms for various demographic and phenotypic groups. 2. Related Work Automated Facial Analysis. Automated facial image analysis describes a range of face perception tasks including, but not limited to, face detection (Zafeiriou et al., 2015; Mathias et al., 2014; Bai and Ghanem, 2017), face classification (Reid et al., 2013; Levi and Hassner, 2015a; Rothe et al., 2016) and face recognition (Parkhi et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2016; Ranjan et al., 2017). Face recognition software is now built into most smart phones and companies such as Google, IBM, Microsoft and Face++ have released commercial software that perform automated facial analysis (IBM; Microsoft; Face++; Google). A number of works have gone further than solely performing tasks like face detection, recognition and classification that are easy for humans to perform. For example, companies such as Affectiva (Affectiva) and researchers in academia attempt to identify emotions from images of people’s faces (Dehghan et al., 2017; Srinivasan et al., 2016; Fabian Benitez-Quiroz et al., 2016). Some works have also used automated facial analysis to understand and help those with autism (Leo et al., 2015; Palestra et al., 2016). Controversial papers such as (Kosinski and Wang, 2017) claim to determine the sexuality of Caucasian males whose profile pictures are on Facebook or dating sites. And others such as (Wu and Zhang, 2016) and Israeli based company Faception (Faception) have developed software that purports to determine an individual’s characteristics (e.g. propensity towards crime, IQ, terrorism) solely from 2 Gender Shades their faces. The clients of such software include governments. An article by (Aguera Y Arcas et al., 2017) details the dangers and errors propagated by some of these aforementioned works. Face detection and classification algorithms are also used by US-based law enforcement for surveillance and crime prevention purposes. In “The Perpetual Lineup”, Garvie and colleagues provide an in-depth analysis of the unregulated police use of face recognition and call for rigorous standards of automated facial analysis, racial accuracy testing, and regularly informing the public about the use of such technology (Garvie et al., 2016). Past research has also shown that the accuracies of face recognition systems used by US-based law enforcement are systematically lower for people labeled female, Black, or between the ages of 18—30 than for other demographic cohorts (Klare et al., 2012). The latest gender classification report from the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) also shows that algorithms NIST evaluated performed worse for female-labeled faces than male-labeled faces (Ngan et al., 2015). The lack of datasets that are labeled by ethnicity limits the generalizability of research exploring the impact of ethnicity on gender classification accuracy. While the NIST gender report explored the impact of ethnicity on gender classification through the use of an ethnic proxy (country of origin), none of the 10 locations used in the study were in Africa or the Caribbean where there are significant Black populations. On the other hand, Farinella and Dugelay claimed that ethnicity has no effect on gender classification, but they used a binary ethnic categorization scheme: Caucasian and non-Caucasian (Farinella and Dugelay, 2012). To address the underrepresentation of people of African-descent in previous studies, our work explores gender classification on African faces to further scholarship on the impact of phenotype on gender classification. Benchmarks. Most large-scale attempts to collect visual face datasets rely on face detection algorithms to first detect faces (Huang et al., 2007; Kemelmacher-Shlizerman et al., 2016). Megaface, which to date is the largest publicly available set of facial images, was composed utilizing Head Hunter (Mathias et al., 2014) to select one million images from the Yahoo Flicker 100M image dataset (Thomee et al., 2015; Kemelmacher-Shlizerman et al., 2016). Any systematic error found in face detectors will inevitably affect the composition of the benchmark. Some datasets collected in this manner have already been documented to contain significant demographic bias. For example, LFW, a dataset composed of celebrity faces which has served as a gold standard benchmark for face recognition, was estimated to be 77.5% male and 83.5% White (Han and Jain, 2014). Although (Taigman et al., 2014)’s face recognition system recently reported 97.35% accuracy on the LFW dataset, its performance is not broken down by race or gender. Given these skews in the LFW dataset, it is not clear that the high reported accuracy is applicable to people who are not well represented in the LFW benchmark. In response to these limitations, Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) released the IJB-A dataset as the most geographically diverse set of collected faces (Klare et al., 2015). In order to limit bias, no face detector was used to select images containing faces. In comparison to face recognition, less work has been done to benchmark performance on gender classification. In 2015, the Adience gender and age classification benchmark was released (Levi and Hassner, 2015b). As of 2017, The National Institute of Standards and Technology is starting another challenge to spur improvement in face gender classification by expanding on the 2014-15 study. 3. Intersectional Benchmark An evaluation of gender classification performance currently requires reducing the construct of gender into defined classes. In this work we use the sex labels of “male” and “female” to define gender classes since the evaluated benchmarks and classification systems use these binary labels. An intersectional evaluation further requires a dataset representing the defined genders with a range of phenotypes that enable subgroup accuracy analysis. To assess the suitability of existing datasets for intersectional benchmarking, we provided skin type annotations for unique subjects within two selected datasets, and compared the distribution of darker females, darker males, lighter females, and lighter males. Due to phenotypic imbalances in existing benchmarks, we 3 Gender Shades Figure 1: Example images and average faces from the new Pilot Parliaments Benchmark (PPB). As the examples show, the images are constrained with relatively little variation in pose. The subjects are composed of male and female parliamentarians from 6 countries. On average, Senegalese subjects are the darkest skinned while those from Finland and Iceland are the lightest skinned. created a new dataset with more balanced skin type and gender representations. 3.1. Rationale for Phenotypic Labeling Though demographic labels for protected classes like race and ethnicity have been used for performing algorithmic audits (Friedler et al., 2016; Angwin et al., 2016) and assessing dataset diversity (Han and Jain, 2014), phenotypic labels are seldom used for these purposes. While race labels are suitable for assessing potential algorithmic discrimination in some forms of data (e.g. those used to predict criminal recidivism rates), they face two key limitations when used on visual images. First, subjects’ phenotypic features can vary widely within a racial or ethnic category. For example, the skin types of individuals identifying as Black in the US can represent many hues. Thus, facial analysis benchmarks consisting of lighter-skinned Black individuals would not adequately represent darker-skinned ones. Second, racial and ethnic categories are not consistent across geographies: even within countries these categories change over time. Since race and ethnic labels are unstable, we decided to use skin type as a more visually precise label to measure dataset diversity. Skin type is one phenotypic attribute that can be used to more objectively characterize datasets along with eye and nose shapes. Furthermore, skin type was chosen as a phenotypic factor of interest because default camera settings are calibrated to expose lighter-skinned individuals (Roth, 2009). Poorly exposed images that result from sensor optimizations for lighter-skinned subjects or poor illumination can prove challenging for automated facial analysis. By labeling faces with skin type, we can increase our understanding of performance on this important phenotypic attribute. 3.2.

We chose to evaluate this dataset given the government’s involvement and the explicit development of the benchmark to be geographically diverse (as mentioned in Sec. 2). At the time of assessment in April and May of 2017, the dataset consisted of 500 unique subjects who are public figures. One image of each unique subject was manually labeled with one of six Fitzpatrick skin types (TB, 1988). Adience is a gender classification benchmark released in 2014 and was selected due to its recency and unconstrained nature. The Adience benchmark contains 2, 284 unique individual subjects. 2, 194 of those subjects had reference images that were discernible enough to be labeled by skin type and gender. Like the IJB-A dataset, only one image of each subject was labeled for skin type. 3.3. Creation of Pilot Parliaments Benchmark Preliminary analysis of the IJB-A and Adience benchmarks revealed overrepresentation of lighter males, underrepresentation of darker females, and underrepresentation of darker individuals in general. We developed the Pilot Parliaments Benchmark (PPB) to achieve better intersectional representation on the basis of gender and skin type. PPB consists of 1270 individuals from three African countries (Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa) and three European countries (Iceland, Finland, Sweden) selected for gender parity in the national parliaments.

Figure 1 shows example images from PPB as well as average faces of males and females in each country represented in the datasets. We decided to use images of parliamentarians since they are public figures with known identities and photos available under non-restrictive licenses posted on government websites. To add skin 5 Gender Shades type diversity to the dataset, we chose parliamentarians from African and European countries. Fig. 2 shows an approximated distribution of average skin types around the world. As seen in the map, African countries typically have darker-skinned individuals whereas Nordic countries tend to have lighter-skinned citizens. Colonization and migration patterns nonetheless influence the phenotypic distribution of skin type and not all Africans are darker-skinned. Similarly, not all citizens of Nordic countries can be classified as lighter-skinned. The specific African and European countries were selected based on their ranking for gender parity as assessed by the Inter Parliamentary Union (Inter Parliamentary Union Ranking). Of all the countries in the world, Rwanda has the highest proportion of women in parliament. Nordic countries were also well represented in the top 10 nations. Given the gender parity and prevalence of lighter skin in the region, Iceland, Finland, and Sweden were chosen. To balance for darker skin, the next two highest-ranking African nations, Senegal and South Africa, were also added. Table 1 compares image characteristics of PPB with IJB-A and Adience. PPB is highly constrained since it is composed of official profile photos of parliamentarians. These profile photos are taken under conditions with cooperative subjects where pose is relatively fixed, illumination is constant, and expressions are neutral or smiling. Conversely, the images in the IJB-A and Adience benchmarks are unconstrained and subject pose, illumination, and expression by construction have more variation. 3.4. Intersectional Labeling Methodology Skin Type Labels. We chose the Fitzpatrick six-point labeling system to determine skin type labels given its scientific origins. Dermatologists use this scale as the gold standard for skin classification and determining risk for skin cancer (TB, 1988). The six-point Fitzpatrick classification system which labels skin as Type I to Type VI is skewed towards lighter skin and has three categories that can be applied to people perceived as White (Figure 2). Yet when it comes to fully representing the sepia spectrum that characterizes the rest of PPB IJB-A Adience 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% 21.3 25.0 23.3 30.3 4.4 16.0 20.2 59.4 7.4 6.4 44.6 41.6 %Darker Female %Darker Male %Lighter Female %Ligher Male Figure 3: The percentage of darker female, lighter female, darker male, and lighter male subjects in PPB, IJB-A and Adience. Only 4.4% of subjects in Adience are darker-skinned and female in comparison to 21.3% in PPB. the world, the categorizations are fairly coarse. Nonetheless, the scale provides a scientifically based starting point for auditing algorithms and datasets by skin type. Gender Labels. All evaluated companies provided a “gender classification” feature that uses the binary sex labels of female and male. This reductionist view of gender does not adequately capture the complexities of gender or address transgender identities. The companies provide no documentation to clarify if their gender classification systems which provide sex labels are classifying gender identity or biological sex. To label the PPB data, we use female and male labels to indicate subjects perceived as women or men respectively. Labeling Process. For existing benchmarks, one author labeled each image with one of six Fitzpatrick skin types and provided gender annotations for the IJB-A dataset. The Adience benchmark was already annotated for gender. These preliminary skin type annotations on existing datasets were used to determine if a new benchmark was needed. More annotation resources were used to label PPB. For the new parliamentarian benchmark, 3 annotators including the authors provided gender and Fitzpatrick labels. A board-certified surgical dermatologist provided the definitive labels for the Fitzpatrick skin type. Gender labels were determined based on the name of the parliamentarian, gendered title, prefixes such as Mr or Ms, and the appearance of the photo. 6 Gender Shades Set n F M Darker Lighter DF DM LF LM All Subjects 1270 44.6% 55.4% 46.4% 53.6% 21.3% 25.0% 23.3% 30.3% Africa 661 43.9% 56.1% 86.2% 13.8% 39.8% 46.4% 4.1% 9.7% South Africa 437 41.4% 58.6% 79.2% 20.8% 35.2% 43.9% 6.2% 14.6% Senegal 149 43.0% 57.0% 100.0% 0.0% 43.0% 57.0% 0.0% 0.0% Rwanda 75 60.0% 40.0% 100.0% 0.0% 60.0% 40.0% 0.0% 0.0% Europe 609 45.5% 54.5% 3.1% 96.9% 1.3% 1.8% 44.2% 52.7% Sweden 349 46.7% 53.3% 4.9% 95.1% 2.0% 2.9% 44.7% 50.4% Finland 197 42.6% 57.4% 1.0% 99.0% 0.5% 0.5% 42.1% 56.9% Iceland 63 47.6% 52.4% 0.0% 100.0% 0.0% 0.0% 47.6% 52.4% Table 2: Pilot Parliaments Benchmark decomposition by the total number of female subjects denoted as F, total number of male subjects (M), total number of darker and lighter subjects, as well as female darker/lighter (DF/LF) and male darker/lighter subjects (DM/LM).

Adience has the most skewed distribution with 86.2% of the subjects consisting of lighter-skinned individuals whereas PPB is more evenly distributed between lighter (53.6%) and darker (46.4%) subjects. 3.5. Fitzpatrick Skin Type Comparison For the purposes of our analysis, lighter subjects will refer to faces with a Fitzpatrick skin type of I,II, or III. Darker subjects will refer to faces labeled with a Fitzpatrick skin type of IV,V, or VI. We intentionally choose countries with majority populations at opposite ends of the skin type scale to make the lighter/darker dichotomy more distinct. The skin types are aggregated to account for potential off-by-one errors since the skin type is estimated using images instead of employing a standard spectrophotometer and Fitzpatrick questionnaire. Table 2 presents the gender, skin type, and intersectional gender by skin type composition of PPB. And Figure 3 compares the percentage of images from darker female, darker male, lighter female and lighter male subjects from Adience, IJB-A, and PBB. PPB provides the most balanced representation of all four groups whereas IJB-A has the least balanced distribution. Darker females are the least represented in IJB-A (4.4%) and darker males are the least represented in Adience (6.4%). Lighter males are the most represented unique subjects in all datasets. IJB-A is composed of 59.4% unique lighter males whereas this percentage is reduced to 41.6% in Adience and 30.3% in PPB. As seen in Table 3, Adience has the most skewed distribution by skin type. While all the datasets have more lighterskinned unique individuals, PPB is around half light at 53.6% whereas the proportion of lighterskinned unique subjects in IJB-A and Adience 7 Gender Shades is 79.6% and 86.2% respectively. PPB provides substantially more darker-skinned unique subjects than IJB-A and Adience. Even though Adience has 2194 labeled unique subjects, which is nearly twice that of the 1270 subjects in PPB, it has 302 darker subjects, nearly half the 589 darker subjects in PPB. Overall, PPB has a more balanced representation of lighter and darker subjects as compared to the IJB-A and Adience datasets. 4. Commercial Gender Classification Audit We evaluated 3 commercial gender classifiers. Overall, male subjects were more accurately classified than female subjects replicating previous findings (Ngan et al., 2015), and lighter subjects were more accurately classified than darker individuals. An intersectional breakdown reveals that all classifiers performed worst on darker female subjects. 4.1. Key Findings on Evaluated Classifiers • All classifiers perform better on male faces than female faces (8.1% − 20.6% difference in error rate) • All classifiers perform better on lighter faces than darker faces (11.8% − 19.2% difference in error rate) • All classifiers perform worst on darker female faces (20.8% − 34.7% error rate) • Microsoft and IBM classifiers perform best on lighter male faces (error rates of 0.0% and 0.3% respectively) • Face++ classifiers perform best on darker male faces (0.7% error rate) • The maximum difference in error rate between the best and worst classified groups is 34.4% 4.2. Commercial Gender Classifier Selection: Microsoft, IBM, Face++ We focus on gender classifiers sold in API bundles made available by Microsoft, IBM, and Face++ (Microsoft; IBM; Face++). Microsoft’s Cognitive Services Face API and IBM’s Watson Visual Recognition API were chosen since both companies have made large investments in artificial intelligence, capture significant market shares in the machine learning services domain, and provide public demonstrations of their facial analysis technology. At the time of evaluation, Google did not provide a publicly available gender classifier. Previous studies have shown that face recognition systems developed in Western nations and those developed in Asian nations tend to perform better on their respective populations (Phillips et al., 2011). Face++, a computer vision company headquartered in China with facial analysis technology previously integrated with some Lenovo computers, was thus chosen to see if this observation holds for gender classification. Like Microsoft and IBM, Face++ also provided a publicly available demonstration of their gender classification capabilities at the time of evaluation(April and May 2017). All of the companies offered gender classification as a component of a set of proprietary facial analysis API services (Microsoft; IBM; Face++). The description of classification methodology lacked detail and there was no mention of what training data was used. At the time of evaluation, Microsoft’s Face Detect service was described as using advanced statistical algorithms that “may not always be 100% precise” (Microsoft API Reference). IBM Watson Visual Recognition and Face++ services were said to use deep learningbased algorithms (IBM API Reference; Face++ Terms of Service). None of the commercial gender classifiers chosen for this analysis reported performance metrics on existing gender estimation benchmarks in their provided documentation. The Face++ terms of use explicitly disclaim any warranties of accuracy. Only IBM provided confidence scores (between 0 and 1) for face-based gender classification labels. But it did not report how any metrics like true positive rates (TPR) or false positive rates (FPR) were balanced. 4.3.

Results for South Africa follow the overall trend with the highest error rates seen on darker-skinned females. the overall classification accuracy, male classification accuracy, and female classification accuracy as measured by the true positive rate (TPR). Extending beyond the NIST methodology we also evaluate the positive predictive value, false positive rate, and error rate (1-TPR) of the following groups: all subjects, male subjects, female subjects, lighter subjects, darker subjects, darker females, darker males, lighter females, and lighter males. See Table 2 in supplementary materials for results disaggregated by gender and each Fitzpatrick Skin Type. 9 Gender Shades 4.4. Audit Results Male and Female Error Rates To conduct a demographic performance analysis, the differences in male and female error rates for each gender classifier are compared first in aggregate (Table 4) and then for South Africa (Table 5). The NIST Evaluation of Automated Gender Classification Algorithms report revealed that gender classification performance on female faces was 1.8% to 12.5% lower than performance on male faces for the nine evaluated algorithms (Ngan et al., 2015). The gender misclassification rates on the Pilot Parliaments Benchmark replicate this trend across all classifiers. The differences between female and male classification error rates range from 8.1% to 20.6%. The relatively high positive predictive value for females indicate that when a face is predicted to be female the estimation is more likely to be correct than when a face is predicted to be male. For the Microsoft and IBM classifiers, the false positive rates (FPR) for males are triple or more than the FPR for females. The FPR for males is more than 30 times that of females with the Face++ classifier. Darker and Lighter Error Rates To conduct a phenotypic performance analysis, the differences in darker and lighter skin type error rates for each gender classifier are compared first in aggregate (Table 4) and then for South Africa (Table 5). All classifiers perform better on lighter subjects than darker subjects in PPB. Microsoft achieves the best result with error rates of 12.9% on darker subjects and 0.7% on lighter individuals. On darker subjects, IBM achieves the worst classification accuracy with an error rate of 22.4%. This rate is nearly 7 times higher than the IBM error rate on lighter faces. Intersectional Error Rates To conduct an intersectional demographic and phenotypic analysis, the error rates for four intersectional groups (darker females, darker males, lighter females and lighter males) are compared in aggregate and then for South Africa. Across the board, darker females account for the largest proportion of misclassified subjects. Even though darker females make up 21.3% of the PPB benchmark, they constitute between 61.0% to 72.4% of the classification error. Lighter males who make up 30.3% of the benchmark contribute only 0.0% to 2.4% of the total errors from these classifiers (See Table 1 in supplementary materials). We present a deeper look at images from South Africa to see if differences in algorithmic performance are mainly due to image quality from each parliament. In PPB, the European parliamentary images tend to be of higher resolution with less pose variation when compared to images from African parliaments. The South African parliament, however, has comparable image resolution and has the largest skin type spread of all the parliaments. Lighter subjects makeup 20.8% (n=91) of the images, and darker subjects make up the remaining 79.2% (n=346) of images. Table 5 shows that all algorithms perform worse on female and darker subjects when compared to their counterpart male and lighter subjects. The Microsoft gender classifier performs the best, with zero errors on classifying all males and lighter females. On the South African subset of the PPB benchmark, all the error for Microsoft arises from misclassifying images of darker females. Table 5 also shows that all classifiers perform worse on darker females. Face++ is flawless on lighter males. IBM performs best on lighter females with 0.0% error rate. Examining classification performance on the South African subset of PPB reveals trends that closely match the algorithmic performance on the entire dataset. Thus, we conclude that variation in performance due to the image characteristics of each country does not fully account for the differences in misclassification rates between intersectional subgroups. In other words, the presence of more darker individuals is a better explanation for error rates than a deviation in how images of parliamentarians are composed and produced. However, darker skin alone may not be fully responsible for misclassification. Instead, darker skin may be highly correlated with facial geometries or gender display norms that were less represented in the training data of the evaluated classifiers. 10 Gender Shades ●●● ● ● ●● ● ●● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●● ● ● ●● ● ●● ● ● ● ●● ● ● ●● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●● ● ●● ● ● ●●● ● ● ● ● ●● ● ● ● ● 0.00 ●● 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Darker Female Darker Male Lighter Female Lighter Male Group Confidence Scores Gender Female Male Figure 4: Gender classification confidence scores from IBM (IBM). Scores are near 1 for lighter male and female subjects while they range from ∼ 0.75 − 1 for darker females. 4.5. Analysis of Results The overall gender classification accuracy results show the obfuscating nature of single performance metrics. Taken at face value, gender classification accuracies ranging from 87.9% to 93.7% on the PPB dataset, suggest that these classifiers can be used for all populations represented by the benchmark. A company might justify the market readiness of a classifier by presenting performance results in aggregate. Yet a gender and phenotypic breakdown of the results shows that performance differs substantially for distinct subgroups. Classification is 8.1% − 20.6% worse on female than male subjects and 11.8% − 19.2% worse on darker than lighter subjects. Though helpful in seeing systematic error, gender and skin type analysis by themselves do not present the whole story. Is misclassification distributed evenly amongst all females? Are there other factors at play? Likewise, is the misclassification of darker skin uniform across gender? The intersectional error analysis that targets gender classification performance on darker female, lighter female, darker male, and lighter male subgroups provides more answers. Darker females have the highest error rates for all gender classifiers ranging from 20.8% − 34.7%. For Microsoft and IBM classifiers lighter males are the best classified group with 0.0% and 0.3% error rates respectively. Face++ classifies darker males best with an error rate of 0.7%. When examining the gap in lighter and darker skin classification, we see that even though darker females are most impacted, darker males are still more misclassified than lighter males for IBM and Microsoft. The most improvement is needed on darker females specifically. More broadly, the error gaps between male and female classification along with lighter and darker classification should be closed. 4.6. Accuracy Metrics Microsoft and Face++ APIs solely output single labels indicating whether the face was classified as female or male. IBM’s API outputs an additional number which indicates the confidence with which the classification was made. Figure 4 plots the distribution of confidence values for each of the subgroups we evaluate (i.e. darker females, darker males, lighter females and lighter males). Numbers near 0 indicate low confidence whereas those close to 1 denote high confidence in classifying gender. As shown in the box plots, the API is most confident in classifying lighter males and least confident in classifying darker females. While confidence values give users more information, commercial classifiers should provide additional metrics. All 3 evaluated APIs only provide gender classifications, they do not output probabilities associated with the likelihood of being a particular gender. This indicates that companies are choosing a threshold which determines the classification: if the prediction probability is greater than this threshold, the image is determined to be that of a male (or female) subject, and viceversa if the probability is less than this number. This does not give users the ability to analyze true positive (TPR) and false positive (FPR) rates for various subgroups if different thresholds were to be chosen. The commercial classifiers have picked thresholds that result in specific TPR and FPR rates for each subgroup. And the FPR for some groups can be much higher than those for others. By having APIs that fail to provide the ability to adjust these thresholds, they are limiting users’ ability to pick their own TPR/FPR trade-off. 4.7. Data Quality and Sensors It is well established that pose, illumination, and expression (PIE) can impact the accuracy of automated facial analysis. Techniques to create robust systems that are invariant to pose, illumination, expression, occlusions, and background have received substantial attention in computer vision research (Kakadiaris et al., 2017; Ganguly 11 Gender Shades et al., 2015; Ahmad Radzi et al., 2014). Illumination is of particular importance when doing an evaluation based on skin type. Default camera settings are often optimized to expose lighter skin better than darker skin (Roth, 2009). Underexposed or overexposed images that present significant information loss can make accurate classification challenging. With full awareness of the challenges that arise due to pose and illumination, we intentionally chose an optimistic sample of constrained images that were taken from the parliamentarian websites. Each country had its peculiarities. Images from Rwanda and Senegal had more pose and illumination variation than images from other countries (Figure 1). The Swedish parliamentarians all had photos that were taken with a shadow on the face. The South African images had the most consistent pose and illumination. The South African subset was also composed of a substantial number of lighter and darker subjects. Given the diversity of the subset, the high image resolution, and the consistency of illumination and pose, our finding that classification accuracy varied by gender, skin type, and the intersection of gender with skin type do not appear to be confounded by the quality of sensor readings. The disparities presented with such a constrained dataset do suggest that error rates would be higher on more challenging unconstrained datasets. Future work should explore gender classification on an inclusive benchmark composed of unconstrained images. 5. Conclusion We measured the accuracy of 3 commercial gender classification algorithms on the new Pilot Parliaments Benchmark which is balanced by gender and skin type. We annotated the dataset with the Fitzpatrick skin classification system and tested gender classification performance on 4 subgroups: darker females, darker males, lighter females and lighter males. We found that all classifiers performed best for lighter individuals and males overall. The classifiers performed worst for darker females. Further work is needed to see if the substantial error rate gaps on the basis of gender, skin type and intersectional subgroup revealed in this study of gender classification persist in other human-based computer vi

In a report published on Sept. 18, the Competition and Markets Authority looked into AI foundation models, concluding that while AI can change how people live and work, “these changes may happen quickly and have a significant impact on competition and consumers.”  The competition regulator cautioned that, in the short term, if competition is weak or developers fail to heed consumer protection law, consumers may be exposed to significant levels of false information or AI-enabled fraud.  In the long term, there’s a chance that a handful of firms could end up gaining or entrenching positions of market power, which could lead them not to offer the best products or services, or charge high prices, it said.  “It is essential that these outcomes do not arise,” said the CMA, with CEO Sarah Cardell adding:   “There remains a real risk that the use of AI develops in a way that undermines consumer trust or is dominated by a few players who exert market power that prevents the full benefits being felt across the economy.” To remedy this, the watchdog proposed several “guiding principles” to ensure “consumer protection and healthy competition while allowing full economic benefits.”  These guiding principles appear to focus on increasing access and transparency, particularly when it comes to preventing firms from gaining advantages by using AI models.   CMA principles on AI development. Source: gov.uk The U.K. competition regulator said it will publish an update on the principles and their adoption in early 2024, along with an insight into further developments in the AI ecosystem. It has engaged with AI developers and businesses deploying the technology already, it said.

Updating its guidelines, then, also aligns with the company's own strategic direction.  The search leader still aims to reward original, helpful, and human content that provides value to users.  ""By definition, if you're using AI to write your content, it's going to be rehashed from other sites,"" Google Search Relations team lead John Mueller noted on Reddit.  To SEO or not to SEO? The implications are clear: repetitive or low-quality AI content could still hurt SEO, even as the technology advances. Writers and editors must still play an active role in the process of content creation. The lack of human involvement is risky because AI models have a tendency to hallucinate. Some of the errors may be funny or offensive, but some of them can cost millions of dollars and even put lives in danger.  SEO, or search engine optimization, refers to strategies aimed at improving a website's rankings in search engines like Google. Higher rankings lead to increased visibility and traffic. SEO experts have long tried to ""beat"" search algorithms by optimizing content to match the Google algorithm.  Google seems to be penalizing the use of AI for simple content summarization or rephrasing, and has its own ways of detecting AI-generated content.  Want to be a crypto expert?

Your Email you@emailaddress.com  Get it! “This classifier process is entirely automated, using a machine-learning model.” Google says, meaning it’s using AI to tell good and bad content apart.  However, part of the challenge is that detecting AI content often relies on imprecise tools. OpenAI itself removed its own AI classifier recently, acknowledging its inaccuracy. AI detection is hard because models are actually trained to “appear” human, so the confrontation between content generators and content discriminators will never end because AI models only get more powerful and accurate as time goes by.  Further, training AI with AI-generated content generations can lead to model collapse.  Google says it is not trying to reproduce AI-generated data, but rather identify it and reward human-written content accordingly. This approach is more akin to training a specialized AI discriminator, where an AI model tries to create something that looks natural and another model tries to distinguish whether the creation is natural or artificial. This process is already in use in generative adversarial networks (GANs).  Standards will continue to evolve as AI proliferates. For now, Google appears focused on content quality rather than separating human contributions from those created with machines."
https://www.wired.com/story/ai-hype-cycle-burnout/	This Is the Worst Part of the AI Hype Cycle	EARLIER THIS WEEK, Paul McCartney sent the music-nerd internet ablaze with some news: Artificial intelligence had helped resurrect a bit of John Lennon’s voice for a new Beatles song, more than four decades after his death. The song is set for release later this year and comes from vocals Lennon recorded on an old demo. “We were able to take John’s voice and get it pure through this AI,” McCartney told BBC Radio 4, “so then we could mix the record, as you would normally do.”  AI Could Usher in a New Era of Music. Will It Suck? AUTO TUNES AI Could Usher in a New Era of Music. Will It Suck? AMOS BARSHAD  ‘One Margarita’ Is the Song of Summer&-and the Moment THE MONITOR ‘One Margarita’ Is the Song of Summer—and the Moment ANGELA WATERCUTTER  Generative AI Podcasts Are Here. Prepare to Be Bored PASSIVE VOICE Generative AI Podcasts Are Here. Prepare to Be Bored KATE KNIBBS  The reaction this elicited on WIRED Slack channels was somewhere between “cool” and “gross.” Using AI to resurrect Lennon for a new song has its appeal, but given the recent ethical questions around using the technology to make fake songs from artists like Drake and The Weeknd, it also feels icky. Based on how McCartney described the process, it sounded like the AI involved simply cleaned up some rough audio, rather than recreated Lennon whole cloth, like it did with Drake, but the reaction to the song pointed to something else: This moment, this time, is the worst part of the AI hype cycle.  You likely know what this means even if you don’t know it in those words. The hype cycle, as defined by Gartner, which tracks it, is that series of cyclical events that happens around nearly all emerging technologies: the breakthrough, the “peak of inflated expectations,” the disillusionment, the period of actual serviceable uses of the tech, and the time when it’s adopted. That pinnacle is the groan time, the moment Justin Bieber drops more than $1 million on an NFT. The moment Facebook buys Oculus. The moment the bodega starts taking bitcoin and you know you’ll never be able to escape this thing, whatever it is.  The Monitor is a weekly column devoted to everything happening in the WIRED world of culture, from movies to memes, TV to Twitter.  This isn’t to say AI is over-hyped. Just that society has now hit the point where people in every field are now enamored with it, and experimenting. That will lead to wild new creations, like books written with ChatGPT, and oof-worthy moves like lawyers using AI to write legal briefs and citing nonexistent cases. It’s Holly Herndon deepfaking her own voice, and Spotify, Apple Music, and other streaming services getting flooded with bot-generated tunes. Until all of AI’s killer applications surface, anything can be a killer app.  This overwhelming moment may feel even more daunting because it’s on the heels of so many hype cycles. The eruption of generative AI comes shortly after Facebook transformed into Meta, crypto outfits like FTX collapsed, and Elon Musk completed his takeover of Twitter. Hype is proliferating, and some of its ensuing disappointments have been, well, disappointing. There’s something to consider beyond the hype cycle: hype burnout.  Living in an era when everything feels like the future is exciting. It’s also exhausting. As each new big idea gets millions in Silicon Valley startup cash, it’s hard to know which one is going to be worth it. At this point, AI seems like a pretty sure bet. It is a genie that cannot be put back into its bottle, and it seems essential that we, the collective “we,” stress-test it for its most essential use cases. But it’s also hard to not want that genie to grant a wish to return things to a simpler time.
https://theintercept.com/2023/07/25/strike-hollywood-ai-disney-netflix/	AS ACTORS STRIKE FOR AI PROTECTIONS, NETFLIX LISTS $900,000 AI JOB	AS HOLLYWOOD EXECUTIVES insist it is “just not realistic” to pay actors — 87 percent of whom earn less than $26,000 — more, they are spending lavishly on AI programs.  While entertainment firms like Disney have declined to go into specifics about the nature of their investments in artificial intelligence, job postings and financial disclosures reviewed by The Intercept reveal new details about the extent of these companies’ embrace of the technology.  In one case, Netflix is offering as much as $900,000 for a single AI product manager.   Hollywood actors and writers unions are jointly striking this summer for the first time since 1960, calling for better wages and regulations on studios’ use of artificial intelligence.    Just after the actors’ strike was authorized, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers — the trade association representing the TV and film companies negotiating with the actors and writers unions — announced “a groundbreaking AI proposal that protects actors’ digital likenesses for SAG-AFTRA members.”   The offer prompted comparisons to an episode of the dystopian sci-fi TV series “Black Mirror,” which depicted actress Salma Hayek locked in a Kafkaesque struggle with a studio which was using her scanned digital likeness against her will.   “Having been poor and rich in this business, I can assure you there’s enough money to go around; it’s just about priorities.” “So $900k/yr per soldier in their godless AI army when that amount of earnings could qualify thirty-five actors and their families for SAG-AFTRA health insurance is just ghoulish,” actor Rob Delaney, who had a lead role in the “Black Mirror” episode, told The Intercept. “Having been poor and rich in this business, I can assure you there’s enough money to go around; it’s just about priorities.”  Among the striking actors’ demands are protections against their scanned likeness being manipulated by AI without adequate compensation for the actors.   “They propose that our background performers should be able to be scanned, get paid for one day’s pay and their company should own that scan, their image, their likeness, and to be able to use it for the rest of eternity in any project they want with no consent and no compensation,” Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, chief negotiator for the actors’ union, SAG-AFTRA, said.   Entertainment writers, too, must contend with their work being replaced by AI programs like ChatGPT that are capable of generating text in response to queries. Writers represented by the Writers Guild of America have been on strike since May 7 demanding, among other things, labor safeguards against AI. John August, a screenwriter for films like “Big Fish” and “Charlie’s Angels,” explained that the WGA wants to make sure that “ChatGPT and its cousins can’t be credited with writing a screenplay.”  Actor Rob Delaney gives a speech during the demonstration.

Photo: Vuk Valcic/Sipa via AP Images Protecting Actors’ Likenesses The daily rate for background actors can be around $200, per the SAG-AFTRA contract. A job posting by the company Realeyes offers slightly more than that: $300 for two hours of work “express[ing] different emotions” and “improvis[ing] brief scenes” to “train an AI database to better express human emotions.”  Realeyes develops technology to measure attention and reactions by users to video content. While the posting doesn’t mention work with streaming companies, a video on Realeyes’s website prominently features the logos for Netflix and Hulu.   The posting is specially catered to attract striking workers, stressing that the gig is for “research” purposes and therefore “does not qualify as struck work”: “Please note that this project does not intend to replace actors, but rather requires their expertise,” Realeyes says, emphasizing multiple times that training AI to create “expressive avatars” skirts strike restrictions.  “The ‘research’ side of this is largely a red herring. Industry research goes into commercial products.” Experts question whether the boundary between research and commercial work is really so clear. “It’s almost a guarantee that the use of this ‘research,’ when it gets commercialized, will be to build digital actors that replace humans,” said Ben Zhao, professor of computer science at the University of Chicago. “The ‘research’ side of this is largely a red herring.” He added, “Industry research goes into commercial products.”  “This is the same bait-switch that LAION and OpenAI pulled years ago,” Zhao said, referring to the Large-scale Artificial Intelligence Open Network, a German nonprofit that created the AI chatbot OpenAssistant; OpenAI is the nonprofit that created AI programs like ChatGPT and DALL-E. “Download everything on the internet and no worries about copyrights, because it’s a nonprofit and research. The output of that becomes a public dataset, then commercial companies (who supported the nonprofit) then take it and say, ‘Gee thanks! How convenient for our commercial products!’”  Netflix AI Manager Netflix’s posting for a $900,000-a-year AI product manager job makes clear that the AI goes beyond just the algorithms that determine what shows are recommended to users.   The listing points to AI’s uses for content creation:“Artificial Intelligence is powering innovation in all areas of the business,” including by helping them to “create great content.” Netflix’s AI product manager posting alludes to a sprawling effort by the business to embrace AI, referring to its “Machine Learning Platform” involving AI specialists “across Netflix.” (Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)  A research section on Netflix’s website describes its machine learning platform, noting that while it was historically used for things like recommendations, it is now being applied to content creation. “Historically, personalization has been the most well-known area, where machine learning powers our recommendation algorithms. We’re also using machine learning to help shape our catalog of movies and TV shows by learning characteristics that make content successful. We use it to optimize the production of original movies and TV shows in Netflix’s rapidly growing studio.”   Related The Internet’s New Favorite AI Proposes Torturing Iranians and Surveilling Mosques Netflix is already putting the AI technology to work. On July 6, the streaming service premiered a new Spanish reality dating series, “Deep Fake Love,” in which scans of contestants’ faces and bodies are used to create AI-generated “deepfake” simulations of themselves.   In another job posting, Netflix seeks a technical director for generative AI in its research and development tech lab for its gaming studio. (Video games often employ voice actors and writers.)  Generative AI is the type of AI that can produce text, images, and video from input data — a key component of original content creation but which can also be used for other purposes like advertising. Generative AI is distinct from older, more familiar AI models that provide things like algorithmic recommendations or genre tags.   “All those models are typically called discriminatory models or classifiers: They tell you what something is,” Zhao explained. “They do not generate content like ChatGPT or image generator models.”   MOST READ  U.S. Helped Pakistan Get IMF Bailout With Secret Arms Deal for Ukraine, Leaked Documents Reveal Ryan Grim, Murtaza Hussain  Confused Automakers Braced for Strike at the Wrong Plants Daniel Boguslaw  Mahmoud Abbas Holocaust Controversy Spotlights Deep Disillusion With Palestinian Authority Alice Speri “Generative models are the ones with the ethics problems,” he said, explaining how classifiers are based on carefully using limited training data — such as a viewing history — to generate recommendations.   Netflix offers up to $650,000 for its generative AI technical director role.   Video game writers have expressed concerns about losing work to generative AI, with one major game developer, Ubisoft, saying that it is already using generative AI to write dialogue for nonplayer characters.  Netflix, for its part, advertises that one of its games, a narrative-driven adventure game called “Scriptic: Crime Stories,” centered around crime stories, “uses generative AI to help tell them.”  Disney’s AI Operations Disney has also listed job openings for AI-related positions. In one, the entertainment giant is looking for a senior AI engineer to “drive innovation across our cinematic pipelines and theatrical experiences.” The posting mentions several big name Disney studios where AI is already playing a role, including Marvel, Walt Disney Animation, and Pixar.  In a recent earnings call, Disney CEO Bob Iger alluded to the challenges that the company would have in integrating AI into their current business model.   “In fact, we’re already starting to use AI to create some efficiencies and ultimately to better serve consumers,” Iger said, as recently reported by journalist Lee Fang. “But it’s also clear that AI is going to be highly disruptive, and it could be extremely difficult to manage, particularly from an IP management perspective.”  Iger added, “I can tell you that our legal team is working overtime already to try to come to grips with what could be some of the challenges here.” Though Iger declined to go into specifics, Disney’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings provide some clues.  “It seems clear that the entertainment industry is willing to make massive investments in generative AI.” “Rules governing new technological developments, such as developments in generative AI, remain unsettled, and these developments may affect aspects of our existing business model, including revenue streams for the use of our IP and how we create our entertainment products,” the filing says.   While striking actors are seeking to protect their own IP from AI — among the union demands that Iger deemed “just not realistic” — so is Disney.   “It seems clear that the entertainment industry is willing to make massive investments in generative AI,” Zhao said, “not just potentially hundreds of millions of dollars, but also valuable access to their intellectual property, so that AI models can be trained to replace human creatives like actors, writers, journalists for a tiny fraction of human wages.”  For some actors, this is not a struggle against the sci-fi dystopia of AI itself, but just a bid for fair working conditions in their industry and control over their own likenesses, bodies, movements, and speech patterns.  “AI isn’t bad, it’s just that the workers (me) need to own and control the means of production!” said Delaney. “My melodious voice? My broad shoulders and dancer’s undulating buttocks? I decide how those are used! Not a board of VC angel investor scumbags meeting in a Sun Valley conference room between niacin IV cocktails or whatever they do.”

AI-generated election ads on YouTube and other Google platforms that alter people or events must include a clear disclaimer located somewhere that users are likely to notice, the company said in an update this week to its political content policy.  The new rule starts in mid-November, just under a year before the U.S. presidential election. It will also affect campaign ads ahead of next year’s elections in India, South Africa, the European Union and other regions where Google already has a verification process for election advertisers.  Though fake images, videos or audio clips are not new to political advertising, generative AI tools are making it easier to do, and more realistic. Some presidential campaigns in the 2024 race — including that of Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis — already are using the technology.  OTHER NEWS FILE - Democratic Gov.

It employed fake but realistic photos showing boarded-up storefronts, armored military patrols in the streets, and waves of immigrants creating panic.  In June, DeSantis’ campaign shared an attack ad against his GOP primary opponent Donald Trump that used AI-generated images of the former president hugging infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci.  Last month the Federal Election Commission began a process to potentially regulate AI-generated deepfakes in political ads ahead of the 2024 election. Such deepfakes can include synthetic voice of political figures saying something they never said.  Democratic U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, co-sponsor of pending legislation that would require disclaimers on deceptive AI-generated political ads, said in a statement that Google’s announcement was a step in the right direction but “we can’t solely rely on voluntary commitments.”  Several states also have discussed or passed legislation related to deepfake technology.  Google is not banning AI outright in political advertising. Exceptions to the ban include synthetic content altered or generated in a way that’s inconsequential to the claims made in the ad. AI can also be used in editing techniques like image resizing, cropping, color, defect correction, or background edits.  The ban will apply to election ads on Google’s own platforms, particularly YouTube, as well as third-party websites that are part of Google’s ad display network.  Google’s action could put some pressure on other platforms to follow its lead. Facebook and Instagram parent Meta doesn’t have a rule specific to AI-generated political ads but already restricts “faked, manipulated or transformed” audio and imagery used for misinformation. TikTok doesn’t allow any political ads. X, formerly Twitter, didn’t immediately reply to an emailed request for comment."

Nvidia said in a regulatory filing this week that the curbs, which affect its A100 and H100 chips designed to speed up machine-learning tasks, would not have an ""immediate material impact"" on its results.  Advertisement · Scroll to continue Rival AMD also received an informed letter with similar restrictions, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters, adding that the move has no material impact on its revenue.  U.S. officials usually impose export controls for national security reasons. A similar move announced last year signaled an escalation of the U.S. crackdown on China's technological capabilities, but it was not immediately clear what risks were posed by exports to the Middle East.

We are working with the U.S. government to address this matter.""  The Commerce Department, which administers licensing requirements on exports, said on Thursday through a spokesperson that the U.S. ""has not blocked chip sales to the Middle East"" and declined to comment on whether it had imposed new requirements on specific US companies.  Advertisement · Scroll to continue Last September AMD said it had received new license requirements that would halt exports of its MI250 artificial-intelligence chips to China.  Nvidia, AMD and Intel (INTC.O) have since then all disclosed plans to create less powerful AI chips that can be exported to the Chinese market.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights  Nvidia, which gave no reason for the new restrictions in the filing dated Aug. 28, last year said U.S. officials informed them the rule ""will address the risk that products may be used in, or diverted to, a 'military end use' or 'military end user' in China.""  Nvidia this week did not specify which countries in the Middle East were affected. The company derived most of its $13.5 billion in sales in its fiscal quarter ended July 30 from the United States, China and Taiwan. About 13.9% of sales came from all other countries combined, and Nvidia does not provide a revenue breakout from the Middle East.  ""During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG (U.S. government) informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East,"" Nvidia said in the Aug. 28 filing.  Last year's announcements came as tensions bubbled over the fate of Taiwan, where chips for Nvidia and almost every other major chip firm are manufactured.  In October 2022, the Biden administration went a step further when it published a sweeping set of export controls, including a measure to cut off China from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with U.S. equipment. The move vastly expanded Washington's reach in its bid to slow Beijing's technological and military advances.  Japan and the Netherlands followed up with similar rules earlier this year.  Without American AI chips from companies like Nvidia and AMD, Chinese organizations will be unable to cost-effectively carry out the kind of advanced computing used for image and speech recognition, among many other tasks.  Image recognition and natural language processing are common in consumer applications like smartphones that can answer queries and tag photos. They also have military uses such as scouring satellite imagery for weapons or bases and filtering digital communications for intelligence-gathering purposes.

Rubber bands helped anchor it in place with the camera facing out. The absurd hat-phone, a particularly uncool version of the future, contained a secret tool known only to a small group of employees. What it could do was remarkable.  The handful of men in the room were laughing and speaking over one another in excitement, as captured in a video taken that day, until one of them asked for quiet. The room went silent; the demo was underway.  Mr. Leyvand turned toward a man across the table from him. The smartphone’s camera lens — round, black, unblinking — hovered above Mr. Leyvand’s forehead like a Cyclops eye as it took in the face before it. Two seconds later, a robotic female voice declared, “Zach Howard.”  “That’s me,” confirmed Mr. Howard, a mechanical engineer.  An employee who saw the tech demonstration thought it was supposed to be a joke. But when the phone started correctly calling out names, he found it creepy, like something out of a dystopian movie.  The person-identifying hat-phone would be a godsend for someone with vision problems or face blindness, but it was risky. Facebook’s previous deployment of facial recognition technology, to help people tag friends in photos, had caused an outcry from privacy advocates and led to a class-action lawsuit in Illinois in 2015 that ultimately cost the company $650 million.  With technology like that on Mr. Leyvand’s head, Facebook could prevent users from ever forgetting a colleague’s name, give a reminder at a cocktail party that an acquaintance had kids to ask about or help find someone at a crowded conference. However, six years later, the company now known as Meta has not released a version of that product and Mr. Leyvand has departed for Apple to work on its Vision Pro augmented reality glasses.  In recent years, the start-ups Clearview AI and PimEyes have pushed the boundaries of what the public thought was possible by releasing face search engines paired with millions of photos from the public web (PimEyes) or even billions (Clearview). With these tools, available to the police in the case of Clearview AI and the public at large in the case of PimEyes, a snapshot of someone can be used to find other online photos where that face appears, potentially revealing a name, social media profiles or information a person would never want to be linked to publicly, such as risqué photos.  What these start-ups had done wasn’t a technological breakthrough; it was an ethical one. Tech giants had developed the ability to recognize unknown people’s faces years earlier, but had chosen to hold the technology back, deciding that the most extreme version — putting a name to a stranger’s face — was too dangerous to make widely available.  Editors’ Picks  He Dissected Trump. Now Michael Wolff Performs an Autopsy on Fox News.  She Pioneered Internet Fame, He Helped Draft a Constitution. Now They’re in Love.  What’s the Best Way to Treat Body Acne? Now that the taboo has been broken, facial recognition technology could become ubiquitous. Currently used by the police to solve crimes, authoritarian governments to monitor their citizens and businesses to keep out their enemies, it may soon be a tool in all our hands, an app on our phone — or in augmented reality glasses — that would usher in a world with no strangers.  ImageHoan Ton-That seated at a table in a house and wearing A.R. glasses The Clearview AI co-founder Hoan Ton-That wearing the A.R. glasses version of Clearview AI.Credit...Kashmir Hill/The New York Times  ‘We decided to stop’ As early as 2011, a Google engineer revealed he had been working on a tool to Google someone’s face and bring up other online photos of them. Months later, Google’s chairman, Eric Schmidt, said in an onstage interview that Google “built that technology, and we withheld it.”  “As far as I know, it’s the only technology that Google built and, after looking at it, we decided to stop,” Mr. Schmidt said.  Advertently or not, the tech giants also helped hold the technology back from general circulation by snapping up the most advanced start-ups that offered it. In 2010, Apple bought a promising Swedish facial recognition company called Polar Rose. In 2011, Google acquired a U.S. face recognition company popular with federal agencies called PittPatt. And in 2012, Facebook purchased the Israeli company Face.com. In each case, the new owners shut down the acquired companies’ services to outsiders. The Silicon Valley heavyweights were the de facto gatekeepers for how and whether the tech would be used.  Facebook, Google and Apple deployed facial recognition technology in what they considered to be relatively benign ways: as a security tool to unlock a smartphone, a more efficient way to tag known friends in photos and an organizational tool to categorize smartphone photos by the faces of the people in them.  In the last few years, though, the gates have been trampled by smaller, more aggressive companies, such as Clearview AI and PimEyes. What allowed the shift was the open-source nature of neural network technology, which now underpins most artificial intelligence software.  Understanding the path of facial recognition technology will help us navigate what is to come with other advancements in A.I., such as image- and text-generation tools. The power to decide what they can and can’t do will increasingly be determined by anyone with a bit of tech savvy, who may not pay heed to what the general public considers acceptable.  ‘Standing on the shoulders of giants’ How did we get to this point where someone can spot a “hot dad” on a Manhattan sidewalk and then use PimEyes to try to find out who he is and where he works? The short answer is a combination of free code shared online, a vast array of public photos, academic papers explaining how to put it all together and a cavalier attitude toward laws governing privacy.  The Clearview AI co-founder Hoan Ton-That, who led his company’s technological development, had no special background in biometrics. Before Clearview AI, he made Facebook quizzes, iPhone games and silly apps, such as “Trump Hair” to make a person in a photo appear to be coifed like the former president.  In his quest to create a groundbreaking and more lucrative app, Mr. Ton-That turned to free online resources, such as OpenFace — a “face recognition library” created by a group at Carnegie Mellon University.

https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/92471-ai-is-about-to-turn-book-publishing-upside-down.html	One afternoon in early 2017, at Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., an engineer named Tommer Leyvand sat in a conference room with a smartphone standing on the brim of his baseball cap. Rubber bands helped anchor it in place with the camera facing out. The absurd hat-phone, a particularly uncool version of the future, contained a secret tool known only to a small group of employees. What it could do was remarkable.  The handful of men in the room were laughing and speaking over one another in excitement, as captured in a video taken that day, until one of them asked for quiet. The room went silent; the demo was underway.  Mr. Leyvand turned toward a man across the table from him. The smartphone’s camera lens — round, black, unblinking — hovered above Mr. Leyvand’s forehead like a Cyclops eye as it took in the face before it. Two seconds later, a robotic female voice declared, “Zach Howard.”  “That’s me,” confirmed Mr. Howard, a mechanical engineer.  An employee who saw the tech demonstration thought it was supposed to be a joke. But when the phone started correctly calling out names, he found it creepy, like something out of a dystopian movie.  The person-identifying hat-phone would be a godsend for someone with vision problems or face blindness, but it was risky. Facebook’s previous deployment of facial recognition technology, to help people tag friends in photos, had caused an outcry from privacy advocates and led to a class-action lawsuit in Illinois in 2015 that ultimately cost the company $650 million.  With technology like that on Mr. Leyvand’s head, Facebook could prevent users from ever forgetting a colleague’s name, give a reminder at a cocktail party that an acquaintance had kids to ask about or help find someone at a crowded conference. However, six years later, the company now known as Meta has not released a version of that product and Mr. Leyvand has departed for Apple to work on its Vision Pro augmented reality glasses.  In recent years, the start-ups Clearview AI and PimEyes have pushed the boundaries of what the public thought was possible by releasing face search engines paired with millions of photos from the public web (PimEyes) or even billions (Clearview). With these tools, available to the police in the case of Clearview AI and the public at large in the case of PimEyes, a snapshot of someone can be used to find other online photos where that face appears, potentially revealing a name, social media profiles or information a person would never want to be linked to publicly, such as risqué photos.  What these start-ups had done wasn’t a technological breakthrough; it was an ethical one. Tech giants had developed the ability to recognize unknown people’s faces years earlier, but had chosen to hold the technology back, deciding that the most extreme version — putting a name to a stranger’s face — was too dangerous to make widely available.  Editors’ Picks  He Dissected Trump. Now Michael Wolff Performs an Autopsy on Fox News.  She Pioneered Internet Fame, He Helped Draft a Constitution. Now They’re in Love.  What’s the Best Way to Treat Body Acne? Now that the taboo has been broken, facial recognition technology could become ubiquitous. Currently used by the police to solve crimes, authoritarian governments to monitor their citizens and businesses to keep out their enemies, it may soon be a tool in all our hands, an app on our phone — or in augmented reality glasses — that would usher in a world with no strangers.  ImageHoan Ton-That seated at a table in a house and wearing A.R. glasses The Clearview AI co-founder Hoan Ton-That wearing the A.R. glasses version of Clearview AI.Credit...Kashmir Hill/The New York Times  ‘We decided to stop’ As early as 2011, a Google engineer revealed he had been working on a tool to Google someone’s face and bring up other online photos of them. Months later, Google’s chairman, Eric Schmidt, said in an onstage interview that Google “built that technology, and we withheld it.”  “As far as I know, it’s the only technology that Google built and, after looking at it, we decided to stop,” Mr. Schmidt said.  Advertently or not, the tech giants also helped hold the technology back from general circulation by snapping up the most advanced start-ups that offered it. In 2010, Apple bought a promising Swedish facial recognition company called Polar Rose. In 2011, Google acquired a U.S. face recognition company popular with federal agencies called PittPatt. And in 2012, Facebook purchased the Israeli company Face.com. In each case, the new owners shut down the acquired companies’ services to outsiders. The Silicon Valley heavyweights were the de facto gatekeepers for how and whether the tech would be used.  Facebook, Google and Apple deployed facial recognition technology in what they considered to be relatively benign ways: as a security tool to unlock a smartphone, a more efficient way to tag known friends in photos and an organizational tool to categorize smartphone photos by the faces of the people in them.  In the last few years, though, the gates have been trampled by smaller, more aggressive companies, such as Clearview AI and PimEyes. What allowed the shift was the open-source nature of neural network technology, which now underpins most artificial intelligence software.  Understanding the path of facial recognition technology will help us navigate what is to come with other advancements in A.I., such as image- and text-generation tools. The power to decide what they can and can’t do will increasingly be determined by anyone with a bit of tech savvy, who may not pay heed to what the general public considers acceptable.  ‘Standing on the shoulders of giants’ How did we get to this point where someone can spot a “hot dad” on a Manhattan sidewalk and then use PimEyes to try to find out who he is and where he works? The short answer is a combination of free code shared online, a vast array of public photos, academic papers explaining how to put it all together and a cavalier attitude toward laws governing privacy.  The Clearview AI co-founder Hoan Ton-That, who led his company’s technological development, had no special background in biometrics. Before Clearview AI, he made Facebook quizzes, iPhone games and silly apps, such as “Trump Hair” to make a person in a photo appear to be coifed like the former president.  In his quest to create a groundbreaking and more lucrative app, Mr. Ton-That turned to free online resources, such as OpenFace — a “face recognition library” created by a group at Carnegie Mellon University. The code library was available on GitHub, with a warning: “Please use responsibly!”  “We do not support the use of this project in applications that violate privacy and security,” read the statement. “We are using this to help cognitively impaired users sense and understand the world around them.”  It was a noble request but completely unenforceable.

"The latest generation of AI is a game changer. Not incremental change—something gentle, something gradual: this AI changes everything, fast. Scary fast.  I believe that every function in trade book publishing today can be automated with the help of generative AI. And, if this is true, then the trade book publishing industry as we know it will soon be obsolete. We will need to move on.  There are two quick provisos, however. The first is straightforward: this is not just about ChatGPT—or other GPTs (generative pretrained transformers) and LLMs (large language models). A range of associated technologies and processes can and will be brought into play that augment the functionality of generative AI. But generative AI is the key ingredient. Without it, what I’m describing is impossible.  The second proviso is of a different flavor. When you make absolutist claims about a technology, people will invariably try to defeat you with another absolute. If you claim that one day all cars will be self-driving, someone will point out that this won’t apply to Formula One race cars. Point taken.   Image: Open AI/DALL-E 2 An AI-generated image from the prompt ""a book cover for a robot's memoir in the style of Peter Mendelsund.""  This isn’t about Formula One publishing. I’m going to be talking about “good enough”—about what people will accept, what they’ll buy, and what they’ll actually read. I’m not going to claim that Formula One publishers won’t be able to do a better job than AI on many of the processes described below. But I’ll challenge you to consider exactly where the human touch brings sufficient added value to justify the overhead in time and costs.  Does any of this mean that there will be no future for great novels and fine nonfiction studies? Of course it doesn’t. That’s not my point.  Do I doubt that there will still be fantastic cover designs from talented designers? Of course there will be. We’ll still stumble on new books on bookstore shelves and, humbled by the grandeur of their cover designs, declare that there’s no way they could have been designed with AI. And sometimes we’ll be right.  Antecedents  My reference point is what we lived through with desktop publishing. Many of the people working in publishing today entered the industry after 1985, when the combo of the Macintosh, the laser printer, and desktop publishing software were first deployed. The initial results were not pretty. The type was rough around the edges, and the letterspacing was crude.  In 1988, when the Macintosh was hooked up to a Linotype machine, the improvement in quality was dramatic. But most traditionalists still argued that the “color” of the type remained poor, and that this lack of quality would be perceived by readers and rejected. The specialists—the designers and their publishing clients—had built careers in part around paying attention to the nuances of specific typefaces, and to kerning, line spacing, and the design of the printed page.  It’s not that this became unimportant, or that there was no appreciable difference; it’s that the new technologies could produce “good enough” quality—a new concept for measuring publishing output: namely, good enough for the vast majority of readers to be perfectly happy with what they were seeing and reading in the books that they purchased.  Acquisitions and editorial  Professional copyediting is the kerning of 2023. The tech is not quite here today. I don’t think that GPT-4 can yet handle copyediting to the standard that book publishers require. But that ability is going to be here sooner, not later. While professionally copyedited books may still be “better” to a refined editor’s eye, you won’t be able to sell more books with the professional human touch. They will already be good enough.   What about developmental editing? You might not let a GPT make the final editorial decisions, but you’d be foolish not to ask it for suggestions.  And ChatGPT will become the patron saint of the slush pile. Its abilities to evaluate grammar and logical expression allow it to make a once-over assessment of whether a book is (reasonably) well written. It might not spot the gems, but it will know how to separate the wheat from the chaff. Ah, you will say, recalling one of those manuscripts that were rejected by 100 publishers but went on to become an unexpected bestseller—surely a GPT might miss those, too. Yet so did 100 purportedly well-trained publishing professionals.  Production  Most book production, print and digital, is already fully automated or semiautomated, mostly rules based. While still evolving and improving, automated page production has been employed for decades—Donald Knuth’s “programmable” typesetting system, TeX, first appeared in 1978. Much of the output of Adobe’s InDesign is automated through macros and scripts. Single-source publishing systems are securely in place.  AI will fill in some of the few missing pieces, but production inefficiencies exist largely because publishing is still, by choice, a high-touch process, based on the largely unshakable belief of many in our industry that the value of human intervention outweighs the lost productivity from automation. This is unquestionably true for multiple categories of publishing. It’s unquestionably false for others.  Distribution and advertising  For the publishing industry, online distribution and advertising have separated writers from readers. Self-published authors have proven that the closer one gets to their audience, the more fans they will get and the more books they will sell. While online resellers aggregate audiences into big broad buckets, AI disambiguates them, enabling writers and readers to forge direct connections.  Amazon has become an overpriced rentier that publishers can ill afford. It can still be a door opener for new authors, but for established publishers it charges too much for what it delivers.   Thad McIlroy  RELATED STORIES: PW issue Contents More in Digital -> Content / e-books Request permission to reprint of this article. FREE E-NEWSLETTERS Enter e-mail address  PW Daily  Tip Sheet  subscribeMore Newsletters Amazon’s dominant position in bookselling is not going to change overnight, nor even in the morning. But part of the publishing transformation that AI will engender will be a series of energetic attempts to disrupt Amazon’s position in the distribution ecosystem. As media continues to morph, AI seeds new delivery channels. Amazon will try to dominate each new channel via acquisitions, as it did so brilliantly when it bought Audible in 2008 for $300 million. But Amazon is a lesser player in the video and gaming spaces, and, as yet, in the new entertainment channels that AI is germinating. This is shaping up as a classic example of Clayton Christensen’s The Innovator’s Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail.  But I see a bright future for bookstores. It can be chilly in AI’s uncanny valley, and bookstores will remain singular sources for camaraderie and the human touch.  Marketing and discovery  Marketing will evolve and prove to be the most powerful facet of AI’s foray into book publishing. This is where the stakes are highest. One thing that could hold it back is a lack of widely available real-time sales information. Subscribers to BookScan will have an edge. It will be fascinating to see what Ingram does to enhance its Marketing Insights product, and what Firebrand does with its Eloquence on Alert.  GPTs can do a great job with competitive analysis and can paint a compelling real-time picture of what’s happening in the market to the books that are siphoning off sales, and to opportunities missed. It’s also going to deliver on the till-now thwarted promise of efficient discovery. Writers will pinpoint their ideal audience and readers will pinpoint their perfect next read.  That’s the tip of the iceberg. Write down the myriad other sales and marketing functions on the back of a napkin and then ask yourself, what might a GPT do to help?  Educational publishing  Think about the transformation of educational publishing over the last two decades. The pursuit of education, training, and learning has not declined in that period; it has only grown larger—every day more and more people are becoming trained and discovering new skills to further their careers, or just out of personal interest. But so much of that is taking place online, on YouTube, Udemy, Coursera, and any other of the hundreds of high-quality and low-cost online resources. (And these too are being disrupted, and mostly enhanced, by GPT technology.)  These developments have had an enormous impact on the industry we call educational publishing, which has shrunk in the past two decades by double digits. Surely a new round of technological disruption could shrink the existing trade publishing industry.  Consider also the growth of self-publishing as a whole. Because the sales data mostly hides under the table, we tend still to understate its impact. But self-publishing has siphoned some billions of dollars per year away from traditional publishing companies. Read ’em and weep.  The entertainment industries  Don’t take your eyes off the entertainment industries at publishing’s periphery, and the impact that this same technology has on them. Movies, games, music, and social media more broadly—all of these industries are being impacted on a scale similar to the publishing business. And these activities are more important to most adults than reading. Time-use studies show adults spend less than 5% of their leisure time reading, and an ever-increasing percentage of their time gaming and watching videos online.  “ AI is going to enable books to morph into additional revenue-producing mediums, in ways we’ve never seen before. ” Enhanced e-books never took off, but sales of books enhanced into audiobooks have exploded beyond anyone’s most optimistic projections. Movies have been books’ love children for more than a century, with some revenue sharing, though that marriage was never fully consummated. Will it be now? Movies and video games have joined near the hip, with book publishing at the periphery. Will that change?  AI is going to enable books to morph into additional revenue-producing mediums, in ways we’ve never seen before.  The perils of AI  I want to put this bluntly. All of this talk about the problems and perils of AI is just a distraction. It’s a distraction from understanding the opportunity that AI brings to book publishing. This is not in the least to undermine the discussion, nor to in any way to suggest that the concerns are invalid or somehow unimportant. But you must fill two deep buckets when you think about AI, promise and peril, and keep a deep moat between them.  If you try to evaluate the opportunity through the lens of the coming AI apocalypse, you’ll have a hard time seeing the green light ahead. You could argue that we as an industry must assess the coming dangers in order to make the hard choices about how AI should be deployed in the publishing industry. Yes, we should make those assessments, and we can make pronouncements. But they will be unenforceable (except, occasionally—and eventually—by law). Entrepreneurs will reach into our industry however they choose, picking off the low-hanging fruit, regardless of the rules that we who are in charge seek to impose. (Did self-published authors listen attentively when we said, “No, you really can’t do that”?)  I’ll take a libertarian tack: you can only understand the perils surrounding a new technology after you fully appreciate the opportunities that it affords.  Forging ahead  I’ve argued (briefly, superficially) that every function in trade book publishing today can be effectively automated with the help of generative AI. If this is true, trade book publishing as we know it will become obsolete. It’s not that books won’t be written and published and read; it’s only that the mechanisms by which they are developed and sold will largely be machine driven, and so the publishing industry will have a very different form. New opportunities will appear behind the fast-closing doors.  “The biggest change to hit publishing since the invention of the printing press” is a hoary old cliché that tries to evoke the scale of a publishing innovation. But is this, finally, the big one? At last fall’s PageBreak conference, Tim O’Reilly, discussing GPTs, said we’re at a point that’s “very similar to how I felt when we discovered the World Wide Web in 1992,” and followed that bold statement with “this is as transformative as VisiCalc, the PC, and the web browser.”  We know how the world was transformed after the invention of the printing press. What will publishing look like after generative AI has been fully assimilated into our current workflows? What will reading look like when books are diminished by GPTs’ I-can-answer-that-question-right-now capabilities? When it can spin a tale that delights?  I don’t shudder to think about this. I couldn’t be more excited."

The researchers believe they have pinpointed 89% of all the key mutations.  The development is expected to speed up diagnosis and help in the search for better treatments.  A leading independent scientist told BBC News that the work was ""a big step forward"".  Prof Ewan Birney, deputy director general of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, said: ""It will help clinical researchers prioritise where to look to find areas that could cause disease.""  The technique works by checking the order of the components in human DNA strands.  All living organisms are built from DNA. It is made from four blocks of chemicals called adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). In humans, when an embryo is developing, the order of these letters are read to produce proteins, which are the building blocks of the the cells and tissues that make up various parts of the body.  But if the letters are in the wrong order - perhaps because of an inherited disorder - the body cells and tissues aren't made properly - and this can lead to disease.  Last year Google DeepMind's AI worked out the shape of nearly all proteins in the human body.  The new system, called AlphaMissense, can tell If the letters in the DNA will produce the correct shape. If not, it is listed as potentially disease-causing.  Graphic showing how faulty DNA causes disease Currently genetic disease hunters have fairly limited limited knowledge of which areas of human DNA can lead to disease. They have classified 0.1% of letter changes, or mutations, as either benign or disease causing.  Google DeepMind's Pushmeet Kohli said that the new model pushed that percentage up to 89%.  Currently, researchers have to search for potentially disease-causing regions across billions of chemical building blocks that make up DNA. That has now changed, according to Mr Kohli.  ''Researchers can now focus their efforts on the new areas, that they were not aware of and we have highlighted as potentially disease-causing,'' he said.  The new tool - published in the journal Science - has been tested by Genomics England, who work with the NHS. According to Dr Ellen Thomas, who is the deputy chief medical officer at Genomics England, the health service will be among the first organisations to benefit from the new development.  ""The new tool is really bringing a new perspective to the data. It will help clinical scientists make sense of genetic data so that it is useful for patients and for their clinical teams,"" she said.  Prof Birney said he expected AI to become a massive part of molecular biology and life sciences.  ""I don't know where it's going to end but it's changing nearly everything we do at the moment,"" he said."
https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/us-china-tech-drones/	In U.S.-China AI contest, the race is on to deploy killer robots	Alongside Sydney Harbour, engineers are working on a submarine that will be powered by artificial intelligence and will have no human crew. The project is being driven by a contest between the U.S., its allies and China to develop AI-controlled weapons that will operate autonomously, including warships and fighter jets. The outcome of this competition could determine the global balance of power.  By DAVID LAGUE Filed Sept. 8, 2023, 11 a.m. GMT SYDNEY   TO meet the challenge of a rising China, the Australian Navy is taking two very different deep dives into advanced submarine technology.  One is pricey and slow: For a new force of up to 13 nuclear-powered attack submarines, the Australian taxpayer will fork out an average of more than AUD$28 billion ($18 billion) apiece. And the last of the subs won’t arrive until well past the middle of the century.  The other is cheap and fast: launching three unmanned subs, powered by artificial intelligence, called Ghost Sharks. The navy will spend just over AUD$23 million each for them – less than a tenth of 1% of the cost of each nuclear sub Australia will get. And the Ghost Sharks will be delivered by mid-2025.  The two vessels differ starkly in complexity, capability and dimension. The uncrewed Ghost Shark is the size of a school bus, while the first of Australia’s nuclear subs will be about the length of a football field with a crew of 132. But the vast gulf in their cost and delivery speed reveal how automation powered by artificial intelligence is poised to revolutionize weapons, warfare and military power – and shape the escalating rivalry between China and the United States. Australia, one of America’s closest allies, could have dozens of lethal autonomous robots patrolling the ocean depths years before its first nuclear submarine goes on patrol.  Without the need to cocoon a crew, the design, manufacture and performance of submarines is radically transformed, says Shane Arnott.

Take away the people, and submarines become much easier and cheaper to build. For starters, Ghost Shark has no pressure hull – the typically tubular, high-strength steel vessel that protects a submarine's crew and sensitive components from the immense force that water exerts at depth.

If China wins out, it will be well placed to reshape the global political and economic order, by force if necessary, according to technology and military experts.  Most Americans alive today have only known a world in which the United States was the single true military superpower, according to a May report, Offset-X, from the Special Competitive Studies Project, a non-partisan U.S. panel of experts headed by former Google Chairman Eric Schmidt. The report outlines a strategy for America to gain and maintain dominance over China in military technology.  If America fails to act, it “could see a shift in the balance of power globally, and a direct threat to the peace and stability that the United States has underwritten for nearly 80 years in the Indo-Pacific,” the report said. “This is not about the anxiety of no longer being the dominant power in the world; it is about the risks of living in a world in which the Chinese Communist Party becomes the dominant power.”  The stakes are also high for Beijing. If the U.S. alliance prevails, it will make it far harder for the People’s Liberation Army, or PLA, as the Chinese military is known, to seize democratically governed Taiwan, control the shipping lanes of East Asia and dominate its neighbors. Beijing sees Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and hasn’t ruled out the use of force to subdue it.  The Department of Defense had no comment “on this particular report,” a Pentagon spokesperson said in response to questions. But the department’s leadership, the spokesperson added, has been “very clear” regarding China as “our pacing challenge.” Regarding a possible attack on Taiwan, the spokesperson said, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other senior leaders “have been very clear that we do not believe an invasion is imminent or inevitable, because deterrence today is real and strong.”  China’s defense ministry and foreign ministry didn’t respond to questions for this article.  A spokesperson for Australia’s Department of Defence said it was a priority to “translate disruptive new technologies into Australian Defence Force capability.” The department is investigating, among other things, “autonomous undersea warfare capabilities to complement its crewed submarines and surface fleet, and enhance their lethality and survivability,” the spokesperson said.   Killer robots  Some leading military strategists say AI will herald a turning point in military power as dramatic as the introduction of nuclear weapons. Others warn of profound dangersif AI-driven robots begin making lethal decisions independently, and have called for a pause in AI research until agreement is reached on regulation related to the military application of AI.  Despite such misgivings, both sides are scrambling to field uncrewed machines that will exploit AI to operate autonomously: subs, warships, fighter jets, swarming aerial drones and ground combat vehicles. These programs amount to the development of killer robots to fight in tandem with human decision makers. Such robots – some designed to operate in teams with conventional ships, aircraft and ground troops – already have the potential to deliver sharp increases in firepower and change how battles are fought, according to military analysts.  Some, like Ghost Shark, are able to perform maneuvers no conventional military vehicle could survive – like diving thousands of meters below the ocean surface.  The Black Hornet 3 nano-drone weighs less than 33 grams, or a bit more than an ounce, and can fly almost silently, giving soldiers a real-time view of the battlefield. Teledyne FLIR handout. Perhaps even more revolutionary than autonomous weapons is the potential for AI systems to inform military commanders and help them decide how to fight – by absorbing and analyzing the vast quantities of data gathered from satellites, radars, sonar networks, signals intelligence and online traffic. Technologists say this information has grown so voluminous it is impossible for human analysts to digest. AI systems trained to crunch this data could deliver commanders with better and faster understanding of a battlefield and provide a range of options for military operations.  Conflict may also be on the verge of turning very personal. The capacity of AI systems to analyze surveillance imagery, medical records, social media behavior and even online shopping habits will allow for what technologists call “micro-targeting” – attacks with drones or precision weapons on key combatants or commanders, even if they are nowhere near the front lines. Kiev’s successful targeting of senior Russian military leaders in the Ukraine conflict is an early example.  AI could also be used to target non-combatants. Scientists have warned that swarms of small, lethal drones could target big groups of people, such as the entire population of military-aged males from a certain town, region or ethnic group.  “They could wipe out, say, all males between 12 and 60 in a city,” said computer scientist Stuart Russell in a BBC lecture on the role of AI in warfare broadcast in late 2021. “Unlike nuclear weapons, they leave no radioactive crater, and they keep all the valuable physical assets intact,” added Russell, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley.

For the U.S. alliance, swarms of cheap drones could offset China’s numerical advantage in missiles, warships and strike aircraft. This could become critical if the United States intervened against an assault by Beijing on Taiwan.  America will field “multiple thousands” of autonomous, unmanned systems within the next two years in a bid to offset China's advantage in numbers of weapons and people, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, Kathleen Hicks, said in an August 28 speech. “We’ll counter the PLA’s mass with mass of our own, but ours will be harder to plan for, harder to hit, harder to beat,” she said.  Even drones with limited AI capability can have an impact. Miniature, remote-controlled surveillance drones with some autonomy are already in service. One example is the pocket-sized Black Hornet 3 now being deployed by multiple militaries.  This drone can fit in the palm of a hand and is hard to detect, according to the website of Teledyne FLIR, the company that makes them. It is reminiscent of the movie “Eye in the Sky,” in which a bug-like drone is used against militants in Kenya. Weighing less than 33 grams, or a bit more than an ounce, it can fly almost silently for 25 minutes, sending back video and high-definition still images to its operator. It gives soldiers in the field a real-time understanding of what is happening around them, according to the company.   Cheap and expendable  The AI military sector is dominated by software, an industry where change comes fast.  Anduril, maker of the AI-powered Ghost Shark, is trying to capitalize on the desire of the U.S. alliance to quickly team humans with intelligent machines. The company, which shares its name with a fictional sword in Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” saga, was founded in 2017 by Palmer Luckey, designer of the Oculus virtual reality headset, now owned by Facebook. Luckey sold Oculus VR to the social media giant for $2.3 billion in 2014.  Arnott, the Anduril engineer working on Ghost Shark, said the company is also supplying equipment to Ukraine. The Russians rapidly adapted to this gear deployed in battle, so Anduril has been pushing out regular updates to maintain an advantage.   Palmer Luckey, founder of the virtual reality company Oculus, displays an Oculus Touch input during an event in San Francisco in 2015. Luckey now heads Anduril, which he says he formed to “radically transform the defense capabilities of the United States.” REUTERS/Robert Galbraith “Something happens,” he said. “We get punched in the face. The customer gets hit with something, and we are able to take that, turn it around and push out a new feature.”  Arnott didn’t provide details of the equipment, but Anduril referred Reuters to a February announcement from the Biden administration that included the company’s ALTIUS 600 munition drone in a package of military aid to Ukraine. This drone can be deployed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. It can also be used as a kamikaze drone,armed with an explosive warhead that can fly into enemy targets.  Ukraine has already reportedly used drone surface craft packed with explosives to attack Russian shipping. Military commentators have suggested that Taiwan could use similar tactics to resist a Chinese invasion, launching big numbers of these vessels into the path of the fleet heading for its beaches.  Asked by Reuters about Taiwan’s drone program, the office of President Tsai Ing-wen said in June that the island had drawn “great inspiration” from Ukraine’s use of drones in its war with Russia.  Footage from a Ukrainian naval drone shows it hitting a Russian warship in the Black Sea in early August. While Russia’s Defence Ministry said the attack by two sea drones had been repelled, footage later showed the warship being towed to shore by a tug and listing heavily.  China, the United States and U.S. allies have programs to build fleets of stealthy drone fighters that will fly in formation with crewed aircraft. The drones could peel off to attack targets, jam communications or fly ahead so their radars and other sensors could provide early warning or find targets. These robots could instantly share information with each other and human operators, according to military technology specialists.  America is planning to build a 1,000-strong fleet of these fighter drones, U.S. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall told a warfare conference in Colorado in March. At the Zhuhai air show in November, China unveiled a jet fighter-like drone, the FH-97A, which will operate with a high degree of autonomy alongside manned combat aircraft, providing intelligence and added firepower, according to reports in the Chinese state-controlled media. China, the United States and Japan are also building large, uncrewed submarines similar to Australia’s Ghost Shark.  One overwhelming advantage of these autonomous weapons: Commanders can deploy them in big numbers without risking the lives of human crews. In some respects, performance improves, too.   The Biden administration has put in place a series of measures aimed at blocking China’s drive to harness AI. Biden, at the time vice president, is seen speaking to the crew aboard the Australian navy ship HMAS Adelaide during a visit to a naval base in Sydney in 2016. REUTERS/Jessica Hromas/Pool Jet-powered robot fighters, for instance, could perform maneuvers the human body wouldn’t tolerate. This would include tight turns involving extreme G-forces, which can cause pilots to pass out. Aerial drones can also do away with the pressurized cockpits, oxygen supplies and ejector seats required to support a human pilot.  And robots don’t get tired. As long as they have power or fuel, they can carry on their missions indefinitely.  Because many robots are relatively cheap – a few million dollars for an advanced fighter drone, versus tens of millions for a piloted fighter jet – losses could be more readily absorbed. For commanders, that means more risk might become acceptable. A robot scout vehicle could approach an enemy ground position to send back high-definition images of defenses and obstacles, even if it is subsequently destroyed, according to Western military experts.   Who is winning?  So far, it is difficult to say who is winning the battle to master AI-powered weapons. China’s huge and sophisticated manufacturing sector gives it advantages in mass production. America remains home to most of the world’s dominant and most innovative technology and software companies. But tight secrecy surrounds the projects on both sides.  Beijing does not publish any detailed breakdown of its increasing defense spending, including outlays on AI. Still, the available disclosures of spending on AI military research do show that outlays on AI and machine learning grew sharply in the decade from 2010.  In 2011, the Chinese government spent about $3.1 million on unclassified AI research at Chinese universities and $8.5 million on machine learning, according to Datenna, a Netherlands-based private research company specializing in open source intelligence on China's industrial and technology sectors. By 2019, AI spending was about $86 million and outlays on machine learning were about $55 million,  Datenna said.   Models of military equipment and a giant screen displaying Chinese President Xi Jinping are seen at an exhibition at the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution in Beijing. Xi has prioritized high-tech military development, telling the Communist Party Congress last October that Beijing would “speed up development of unmanned, intelligent combat capabilities.” REUTERS/Florence Lo  At the Zhuhai air show in November, China unveiled the FH-97A, a jet fighter-like drone that will operate alongside manned combat aircraft. An earlier model of this drone, seen here, was displayed in Zhuhai in 2021. REUTERS/Aly Song “The biggest challenge is we don’t really know how good the Chinese are, particularly when it comes to the military applications of AI,” said Martijn Rasser, a former analyst with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and now managing director of Datenna. “Obviously, China is producing world class research, but what the PLA and PLA-affiliated research institutions are doing specifically is much more difficult to discern.”  The July 1 death in a traffic accident in Beijing of a leading Chinese military AI expert provides a small window into the country’s ambitions.  At the time he died, Colonel Feng Yanghe, 38, was working on a “major task,” state-controlled China Daily reported, without going into detail. Feng had studied at the Department of Statistics at Harvard University, the report said.   Feng Yanghe, one of China’s leading military AI experts, was killed in a traffic accident in Beijing in July. The state-controlled press in China said he had developed a system that could “draft operation plans, conduct risk assessments and provide backup plans in advance based on incomplete tactical data.” Screenshot via the Weibo account of Chinanews.com In China, he headed a team that developed an AI system called “War Skull,” which China Daily said could “draft operation plans, conduct risk assessments and provide backup plans in advance based on incomplete tactical data.” The system had been used in exercises by the PLA, the report said.  The Biden Administration is so concerned about the tech race that it has moved to block China’s drive to conquer AI and other advanced technologies. Last month, Biden signed an executive order that will prohibit some new U.S. investment in China in sensitive technologies that could be used to bolster military capacity.  Anduril, the weaponry start-up created by VR-headset pioneer Palmer Luckey, has ambitions to be a major high-tech defense contractor. The Costa-Mesa, California-based company now employs more than 1,800 staff in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. Luckey’s biography on the company website says he formed Anduril to “radically transform the defense capabilities of the United States and its allies by fusing artificial intelligence with the latest hardware developments.”  Anduril said Luckey was unavailable to be interviewed for this story.  The core of Anduril’s business is its Lattice operating system, which combines technologies including sensor fusion, computer vision, edge computing and AI. The Lattice system drives the autonomous operation of hardware that the company supplies, including aerial drones, anti-drone systems and submarines such as Ghost Shark.  In its biggest commercial success so far, Anduril early last year won a contract worth almost $1 billion to supply U.S. Special Operations Command with a counter-drone system. The U.K. Ministry of Defense has also awarded the company a contract for a base defense system.  Arnott wouldn’t describe the capabilities of Ghost Shark. The vessels will be built at a secret plant on Sydney Harbour in close collaboration with the Australian Navy and defense scientists. “We absolutely can’t talk about any of the applications of this,” he said.  But a smaller, three-tonne autonomous submarine in Anduril’s product line-up, the Dive-LD, suggests what unmanned AI-powered subs can do. The Dive-LD can reach depths of 6,000 meters and operate autonomously for 10 days, according to the company website. The sub, which has a 3D-printed exterior, is capable of engaging in mine counter-warfare and anti-submarine warfare, the site says.   Ukraine’s innovative use of technologies in its war with Russia is heating up competition over weapons powered by artificial intelligence. In this photo, two men place a model of an anti-tank mine on an unmanned ground vehicle as they test the device in the Kyiv region in July. REUTERS/Alina Smutko  Previous Next With no need for a pressure hull, Anduril's Dive-LD can descend far deeper than the manned submarines in military service. The maximum depths reachable by military subs is usually classified information, but naval analysts told Reuters it is somewhere between 300 and 900 meters. The ability to descend to much greater depths can make a sub tougher to detect and attack.  Veteran navy officers say dozens of autonomous submarines like Ghost Shark, armed with a mix of torpedoes, missiles and mines, could lurk off an enemy’s coast or lie in wait at a strategically important waterway or chokepoint. They could also be assigned to strike at targets their AI-powered operating systems have been taught to recognize.  Australia’s nuclear subsea fleet will be more formidable than the unmanned submarines of today. But, they will also take much longer to materialize.  In the first part of the project, the United States will supply up to five Virginia-class submarines to Canberra. The first of those subs will not enter service until early next decade. A further eight of a new class of subs will then be built starting from the 2040s, as part of the same AUD$368 billion project, under the AUKUS agreement, a defense-technology collaboration between Australia, Britain and the United States.  By the time this fleet is an effective force, big numbers of lethal robots operating in teams with human troops and traditional crewed weapons may have changed the nature of war, military strategists say.  “There is a lot of warfare that is dull, dirty and dangerous,” said Arnott. “It is a lot better to do that with a machine.”  Human-machine teams are about to reshape warfare By DAVID LAGUE Some technology experts believe innovative commercial software developers now entering the arms market are challenging the dominance of the traditional defense industry, which produces big-ticket weapons, sometimes at glacial speed.  It is too early to say if big, human-crewed weapons like submarines or reconnaissance helicopters will go the way of the battleship, which was rendered obsolete with the rise of air power. But aerial, land and underwater robots, teamed with humans, are poised to play a major role in warfare.

There, even rudimentary teams of humans and machines operating without significant artificial-intelligence powered autonomy are reshaping the battlefield. Simple, remotely piloted drones have greatly improved the lethality of artillery, rockets and missiles in Ukraine, according to military analysts who study the conflict.  Kathleen Hicks, the U.S. deputy secretary of defense, said in an Aug. 28 speech at a conference on military technology in Washington that traditional military capabilities “remain essential.” But she noted that the Ukraine conflict has shown that emerging technology developed by commercial and non-traditional companies could be “decisive in defending against modern military aggression.”  Both Russian and Ukrainian forces are integrating traditional weapons with AI, satellite imaging and communications, as well as smart and loitering munitions, according to a May report from the Special Competitive Studies Project, a non-partisan U.S. panel of experts. The battlefield is now a patchwork of deep trenches and bunkers where troops have been “forced to go underground or huddle in cellars to survive,” the report said.  Some military strategists have noted that in this conflict, attack and transport helicopters have become so vulnerable that they have been almost forced from the skies, their roles now increasingly handed over to drones.  “Uncrewed aerial systems have already taken crewed reconnaissance helicopters out of a lot of their missions,” said Mick Ryan, a former Australian army major general who publishes regular commentaries on the conflict. “We are starting to see ground-based artillery observers replaced by drones. So, we are already starting to see some replacement.”

The project is being driven by a contest between the U.S., its allies and China to develop AI-controlled weapons that will operate autonomously, including warships and fighter jets. The outcome of this competition could determine the global balance of power.  By DAVID LAGUE Filed Sept. 8, 2023, 11 a.m. GMT SYDNEY   TO meet the challenge of a rising China, the Australian Navy is taking two very different deep dives into advanced submarine technology.  One is pricey and slow: For a new force of up to 13 nuclear-powered attack submarines, the Australian taxpayer will fork out an average of more than AUD$28 billion ($18 billion) apiece. And the last of the subs won’t arrive until well past the middle of the century.  The other is cheap and fast: launching three unmanned subs, powered by artificial intelligence, called Ghost Sharks. The navy will spend just over AUD$23 million each for them – less than a tenth of 1% of the cost of each nuclear sub Australia will get. And the Ghost Sharks will be delivered by mid-2025.  The two vessels differ starkly in complexity, capability and dimension. The uncrewed Ghost Shark is the size of a school bus, while the first of Australia’s nuclear subs will be about the length of a football field with a crew of 132. But the vast gulf in their cost and delivery speed reveal how automation powered by artificial intelligence is poised to revolutionize weapons, warfare and military power – and shape the escalating rivalry between China and the United States. Australia, one of America’s closest allies, could have dozens of lethal autonomous robots patrolling the ocean depths years before its first nuclear submarine goes on patrol.  Without the need to cocoon a crew, the design, manufacture and performance of submarines is radically transformed, says Shane Arnott. He is the senior vice-president of engineering at U.S. defense contractor Anduril, whose Australian subsidiary is building the Ghost Shark subs for the Australian Navy.  “A huge amount of the expense and systems go into supporting the humans,” Arnott said in an interview in the company’s Sydney office.

It is reminiscent of the movie “Eye in the Sky,” in which a bug-like drone is used against militants in Kenya. Weighing less than 33 grams, or a bit more than an ounce, it can fly almost silently for 25 minutes, sending back video and high-definition still images to its operator. It gives soldiers in the field a real-time understanding of what is happening around them, according to the company.   Cheap and expendable  The AI military sector is dominated by software, an industry where change comes fast.  Anduril, maker of the AI-powered Ghost Shark, is trying to capitalize on the desire of the U.S. alliance to quickly team humans with intelligent machines. The company, which shares its name with a fictional sword in Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” saga, was founded in 2017 by Palmer Luckey, designer of the Oculus virtual reality headset, now owned by Facebook. Luckey sold Oculus VR to the social media giant for $2.3 billion in 2014.  Arnott, the Anduril engineer working on Ghost Shark, said the company is also supplying equipment to Ukraine. The Russians rapidly adapted to this gear deployed in battle, so Anduril has been pushing out regular updates to maintain an advantage.   Palmer Luckey, founder of the virtual reality company Oculus, displays an Oculus Touch input during an event in San Francisco in 2015. Luckey now heads Anduril, which he says he formed to “radically transform the defense capabilities of the United States.” REUTERS/Robert Galbraith “Something happens,” he said. “We get punched in the face. The customer gets hit with something, and we are able to take that, turn it around and push out a new feature.”  Arnott didn’t provide details of the equipment, but Anduril referred Reuters to a February announcement from the Biden administration that included the company’s ALTIUS 600 munition drone in a package of military aid to Ukraine. This drone can be deployed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. It can also be used as a kamikaze drone,armed with an explosive warhead that can fly into enemy targets.  Ukraine has already reportedly used drone surface craft packed with explosives to attack Russian shipping. Military commentators have suggested that Taiwan could use similar tactics to resist a Chinese invasion, launching big numbers of these vessels into the path of the fleet heading for its beaches.  Asked by Reuters about Taiwan’s drone program, the office of President Tsai Ing-wen said in June that the island had drawn “great inspiration” from Ukraine’s use of drones in its war with Russia.  Footage from a Ukrainian naval drone shows it hitting a Russian warship in the Black Sea in early August. While Russia’s Defence Ministry said the attack by two sea drones had been repelled, footage later showed the warship being towed to shore by a tug and listing heavily.  China, the United States and U.S. allies have programs to build fleets of stealthy drone fighters that will fly in formation with crewed aircraft. The drones could peel off to attack targets, jam communications or fly ahead so their radars and other sensors could provide early warning or find targets. These robots could instantly share information with each other and human operators, according to military technology specialists.  America is planning to build a 1,000-strong fleet of these fighter drones, U.S. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall told a warfare conference in Colorado in March. At the Zhuhai air show in November, China unveiled a jet fighter-like drone, the FH-97A, which will operate with a high degree of autonomy alongside manned combat aircraft, providing intelligence and added firepower, according to reports in the Chinese state-controlled media. China, the United States and Japan are also building large, uncrewed submarines similar to Australia’s Ghost Shark.  One overwhelming advantage of these autonomous weapons: Commanders can deploy them in big numbers without risking the lives of human crews. In some respects, performance improves, too.   The Biden administration has put in place a series of measures aimed at blocking China’s drive to harness AI. Biden, at the time vice president, is seen speaking to the crew aboard the Australian navy ship HMAS Adelaide during a visit to a naval base in Sydney in 2016. REUTERS/Jessica Hromas/Pool Jet-powered robot fighters, for instance, could perform maneuvers the human body wouldn’t tolerate. This would include tight turns involving extreme G-forces, which can cause pilots to pass out. Aerial drones can also do away with the pressurized cockpits, oxygen supplies and ejector seats required to support a human pilot.  And robots don’t get tired. As long as they have power or fuel, they can carry on their missions indefinitely.  Because many robots are relatively cheap – a few million dollars for an advanced fighter drone, versus tens of millions for a piloted fighter jet – losses could be more readily absorbed. For commanders, that means more risk might become acceptable. A robot scout vehicle could approach an enemy ground position to send back high-definition images of defenses and obstacles, even if it is subsequently destroyed, according to Western military experts.   Who is winning?  So far, it is difficult to say who is winning the battle to master AI-powered weapons. China’s huge and sophisticated manufacturing sector gives it advantages in mass production. America remains home to most of the world’s dominant and most innovative technology and software companies. But tight secrecy surrounds the projects on both sides.  Beijing does not publish any detailed breakdown of its increasing defense spending, including outlays on AI. Still, the available disclosures of spending on AI military research do show that outlays on AI and machine learning grew sharply in the decade from 2010.  In 2011, the Chinese government spent about $3.1 million on unclassified AI research at Chinese universities and $8.5 million on machine learning, according to Datenna, a Netherlands-based private research company specializing in open source intelligence on China's industrial and technology sectors. By 2019, AI spending was about $86 million and outlays on machine learning were about $55 million,  Datenna said.   Models of military equipment and a giant screen displaying Chinese President Xi Jinping are seen at an exhibition at the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution in Beijing. Xi has prioritized high-tech military development, telling the Communist Party Congress last October that Beijing would “speed up development of unmanned, intelligent combat capabilities.” REUTERS/Florence Lo  At the Zhuhai air show in November, China unveiled the FH-97A, a jet fighter-like drone that will operate alongside manned combat aircraft. An earlier model of this drone, seen here, was displayed in Zhuhai in 2021. REUTERS/Aly Song “The biggest challenge is we don’t really know how good the Chinese are, particularly when it comes to the military applications of AI,” said Martijn Rasser, a former analyst with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and now managing director of Datenna. “Obviously, China is producing world class research, but what the PLA and PLA-affiliated research institutions are doing specifically is much more difficult to discern.”  The July 1 death in a traffic accident in Beijing of a leading Chinese military AI expert provides a small window into the country’s ambitions.  At the time he died, Colonel Feng Yanghe, 38, was working on a “major task,” state-controlled China Daily reported, without going into detail. Feng had studied at the Department of Statistics at Harvard University, the report said.   Feng Yanghe, one of China’s leading military AI experts, was killed in a traffic accident in Beijing in July. The state-controlled press in China said he had developed a system that could “draft operation plans, conduct risk assessments and provide backup plans in advance based on incomplete tactical data.” Screenshot via the Weibo account of Chinanews.com In China, he headed a team that developed an AI system called “War Skull,” which China Daily said could “draft operation plans, conduct risk assessments and provide backup plans in advance based on incomplete tactical data.” The system had been used in exercises by the PLA, the report said.  The Biden Administration is so concerned about the tech race that it has moved to block China’s drive to conquer AI and other advanced technologies. Last month, Biden signed an executive order that will prohibit some new U.S. investment in China in sensitive technologies that could be used to bolster military capacity.  Anduril, the weaponry start-up created by VR-headset pioneer Palmer Luckey, has ambitions to be a major high-tech defense contractor. The Costa-Mesa, California-based company now employs more than 1,800 staff in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. Luckey’s biography on the company website says he formed Anduril to “radically transform the defense capabilities of the United States and its allies by fusing artificial intelligence with the latest hardware developments.”  Anduril said Luckey was unavailable to be interviewed for this story.  The core of Anduril’s business is its Lattice operating system, which combines technologies including sensor fusion, computer vision, edge computing and AI. The Lattice system drives the autonomous operation of hardware that the company supplies, including aerial drones, anti-drone systems and submarines such as Ghost Shark.  In its biggest commercial success so far, Anduril early last year won a contract worth almost $1 billion to supply U.S. Special Operations Command with a counter-drone system. The U.K. Ministry of Defense has also awarded the company a contract for a base defense system.  Arnott wouldn’t describe the capabilities of Ghost Shark. The vessels will be built at a secret plant on Sydney Harbour in close collaboration with the Australian Navy and defense scientists. “We absolutely can’t talk about any of the applications of this,” he said.  But a smaller, three-tonne autonomous submarine in Anduril’s product line-up, the Dive-LD, suggests what unmanned AI-powered subs can do. The Dive-LD can reach depths of 6,000 meters and operate autonomously for 10 days, according to the company website. The sub, which has a 3D-printed exterior, is capable of engaging in mine counter-warfare and anti-submarine warfare, the site says.   Ukraine’s innovative use of technologies in its war with Russia is heating up competition over weapons powered by artificial intelligence. In this photo, two men place a model of an anti-tank mine on an unmanned ground vehicle as they test the device in the Kyiv region in July. REUTERS/Alina Smutko  Previous Next With no need for a pressure hull, Anduril's Dive-LD can descend far deeper than the manned submarines in military service. The maximum depths reachable by military subs is usually classified information, but naval analysts told Reuters it is somewhere between 300 and 900 meters. The ability to descend to much greater depths can make a sub tougher to detect and attack.  Veteran navy officers say dozens of autonomous submarines like Ghost Shark, armed with a mix of torpedoes, missiles and mines, could lurk off an enemy’s coast or lie in wait at a strategically important waterway or chokepoint. They could also be assigned to strike at targets their AI-powered operating systems have been taught to recognize.  Australia’s nuclear subsea fleet will be more formidable than the unmanned submarines of today. But, they will also take much longer to materialize.  In the first part of the project, the United States will supply up to five Virginia-class submarines to Canberra. The first of those subs will not enter service until early next decade. A further eight of a new class of subs will then be built starting from the 2040s, as part of the same AUD$368 billion project, under the AUKUS agreement, a defense-technology collaboration between Australia, Britain and the United States.  By the time this fleet is an effective force, big numbers of lethal robots operating in teams with human troops and traditional crewed weapons may have changed the nature of war, military strategists say.  “There is a lot of warfare that is dull, dirty and dangerous,” said Arnott. “It is a lot better to do that with a machine.”  Human-machine teams are about to reshape warfare By DAVID LAGUE Some technology experts believe innovative commercial software developers now entering the arms market are challenging the dominance of the traditional defense industry, which produces big-ticket weapons, sometimes at glacial speed.  It is too early to say if big, human-crewed weapons like submarines or reconnaissance helicopters will go the way of the battleship, which was rendered obsolete with the rise of air power. But aerial, land and underwater robots, teamed with humans, are poised to play a major role in warfare.  RELATED CONTENT   U.S. and China wage war beneath the waves – over internet cables   Inside the subsea cable firm secretly helping America take on China   Inspired by Ukraine war, Taiwan launches drone blitz to counter China  Evidence of such change is already emerging from the war in Ukraine. There, even rudimentary teams of humans and machines operating without significant artificial-intelligence powered autonomy are reshaping the battlefield. Simple, remotely piloted drones have greatly improved the lethality of artillery, rockets and missiles in Ukraine, according to military analysts who study the conflict.  Kathleen Hicks, the U.S. deputy secretary of defense, said in an Aug. 28 speech at a conference on military technology in Washington that traditional military capabilities “remain essential.” But she noted that the Ukraine conflict has shown that emerging technology developed by commercial and non-traditional companies could be “decisive in defending against modern military aggression.”  Both Russian and Ukrainian forces are integrating traditional weapons with AI, satellite imaging and communications, as well as smart and loitering munitions, according to a May report from the Special Competitive Studies Project, a non-partisan U.S. panel of experts. The battlefield is now a patchwork of deep trenches and bunkers where troops have been “forced to go underground or huddle in cellars to survive,” the report said.  Some military strategists have noted that in this conflict, attack and transport helicopters have become so vulnerable that they have been almost forced from the skies, their roles now increasingly handed over to drones.  “Uncrewed aerial systems have already taken crewed reconnaissance helicopters out of a lot of their missions,” said Mick Ryan, a former Australian army major general who publishes regular commentaries on the conflict. “We are starting to see ground-based artillery observers replaced by drones. So, we are already starting to see some replacement.”	"It's back-to-school season, and educators are buried under the weight of anxiety over the ethical minefield that is artificial intelligence.

In brainstorming sessions, it acts as a collaborative muse, ushering students to explore myriad viewpoints and concoct solutions that transcend disciplinary boundaries. It engenders an atmosphere of open-mindedness, prompting students to think beyond the proverbial box and challenge the status quo. For example, consider a team of architecture and computer science students exploring smart city designs. Claude could suggest they explore urban psychology theories. Inspired, they conceptualize a city plan that adapts in real-time to human behavior.  Improving Communications In the world of trans- and interdisciplinary work, effective communication is not just a nice-to-have, but a make-or-break. Here, generative AI shines as a communication coach, helping students articulate their ideas more coherently and fostering a deeper understanding within their teams. It's like having a Grammarly with a Ph.D. For example, envision a healthcare policy course, where public health majors collaborate with law students to draft a legislative proposal. Generative AI such as Bing could help bridge the terminology gap, explaining legalese in public health terms and vice versa. The platform could ensure that both groups of students can contribute meaningfully to the project, breaking down language barriers that could otherwise lead to misunderstandings.  Enhancing Critical Thinking ChatGPT, especially the paid version with access to advanced data analytics and plugins such as Wolfram Alpha, also earns its stripes as an analytical powerhouse. It dissects complex problems, suggesting interdisciplinary connections that even seasoned academics might overlook. It prompts students to ask novel questions, expanding their understanding of the issues at hand and enhancing students’ critical thinking. For example, consider history and artificial intelligence students working together on a project to model historical outcomes based on different variables. ChatGPT could help them identify overlooked correlations, such as the relation between economic systems and historical contexts. It could suggest that they model this relation through machine learning algorithms. Insights such as these could guide the students’ research in entirely new directions.  Helping Critical Evaluation Moreover, generative AI tools can assist in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches in the students' work. They can assess and identify knowledge gaps and offer guidance on how to bridge these via further investigations. For example, if sociology and data science students were investigating the impact of social media on elections, a generative AI tool such as Bard could act as an advisor, pointing out that their project lacks a cybersecurity angle to fully grasp the topic. It could suggest relevant cybersecurity areas to explore further, thereby enhancing the depth and scope of their work.

Large language models (LLMs) such as those embedded in 'chatbots' are accelerating and democratizing research by providing comprehensible information and expertise from many different fields. However, these models may also confer easy access to dual-use technologies capable of inflicting great harm. To evaluate this risk, the 'Safeguarding the Future' course at MIT tasked non-scientist students with investigating whether LLM chatbots could be prompted to assist non-experts in causing a pandemic. In one hour, the chatbots suggested four potential pandemic pathogens, explained how they can be generated from synthetic DNA using reverse genetics, supplied the names of DNA synthesis companies unlikely to screen orders, identified detailed protocols and how to troubleshoot them, and recommended that anyone lacking the skills to perform reverse genetics engage a core facility or contract research organization. Collectively, these results suggest that LLMs will make pandemic-class agents widely accessible as soon as they are credibly identified, even to people with little or no laboratory training. Promising nonproliferation measures include pre-release evaluations of LLMs by third parties, curating training datasets to remove harmful concepts, and verifiably screening all DNA generated by synthesis providers or used by contract research organizations and robotic cloud laboratories to engineer organisms or viruses.
https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/sep/04/the-chilling-rise-of-ai-scams-podcast	The chilling rise of AI scams	Jennifer DiStefano, a mother of four, got a call one day from an unknown number. Two of her children were off snowboarding, so she picked up, worried that one of them might have been injured. It was her daughter Bree, screaming, crying and pleading for help. A man came on the line and told DiStefano that he had kidnapped her daughter and that if she didn’t pay up, he would kill her.  DiStefano was terrified, but her fear and horror was the only real thing about that phone call. Bree had not been kidnapped, she was with her brother, safe. Instead, scammers had used AI to replicate Bree’s voice so accurately that her own mother could not recognise the difference – and they were using it to try to extort money from DiStefano.  Oliver Devane, a senior researcher at the online protection company McAfee, says AI scams such as this are on the rise. Michael Safi hears how criminals are exploiting artificial intelligence to trick their victims, and how we can protect ourselves from falling for it.
https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230829/AI-chatbot-provides-incorrect-cancer-treatment-recommendations.aspx	AI chatbot provides incorrect cancer treatment recommendations	LLMs have shown promise in encoding clinical data and making diagnostic recommendations, with some of these systems recently used to take and subsequently pass the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). Likewise, the OpenAI application ChatGPT, which is part of the generative pre-training transformer (CPT) family of models, has also been used to identify potential research topics, as well as update physicians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals on recent developments in their respective fields.  LLMs can also mimic human dialects and provide prompt, detailed, and coherent responses to queries. However, in some cases, LLMs might provide less reliable information, which could misguide people who often use AI for self-education. Despite providing these systems with reliable and high-quality data, AI is still vulnerable to biases, limiting their applicability for medical applications.  Researchers predict that general users might use an LLM chatbot to query cancer-related medical guidance. Thus, a chatbot providing seemingly correct information but a wrong or less accurate response related to cancer diagnosis or treatment might misguide the person and generate and amplify misinformation.  About the study In the present study, researchers evaluate the performance of an LLM chatbot in providing prostate, lung, and breast cancer treatment recommendations in agreement with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.  Since the knowledge end date of the LLM chatbot was September 2021, this model relied on 2021 NCCN guidelines for establishing treatment recommendations.  Four zero-shot prompt templates were also developed and used to create four variations for 26 cancer diagnosis descriptions for a final total of 104 prompts. These prompts were subsequently provided as input to the GPT-3.5 through the ChatGPT interface.   The study team comprised four board-certified oncologists, three of whom assessed the concordance of the chatbot output with the 2021 NCCN guidelines based on five scoring criteria developed by the researchers. The majority rule was used to determine the final score.  The fourth oncologist helped the other three resolve disagreements, which primarily arose when the LLM chatbot output was unclear. For example, LLM did not specify which treatments to combine for a specific type of cancer.  Study findings A total of 104 unique prompts scored on five scoring criteria yielded 520 scores, from which all three annotators agreed on 322 or 61.9% of scores. Furthermore, the LLM chatbot provided a minimum of one recommendation for 98% of prompts.   Cancer Research eBook Compilation of the top interviews, articles, and news in the last year. Download the latest edition All responses with a treatment recommendation comprised a minimum of one NCCN-concordant treatment. Moreover, 35 of the 102 outputs recommended one or more non-concordant treatments. In 34.6% of cancer diagnosis descriptions, all four prompt templates were given the same scores on all five score criteria.   Over 12% of chatbot responses were not considered NCCI-recommended treatments. These responses, which were described as ‘hallucinations’ by the researchers, were primarily immunotherapy, localized treatment of advanced disease, or other targeted therapies.  LLM chatbot recommendations also varied with the way the researchers phrased their questions. In some cases, the chatbot yielded unclear output, which led to disagreements among three annotators.  Other disagreements arose due to varying interpretations of NCCN guidelines. Nevertheless, these agreements highlighted the difficulty of reliably interpreting LLM output, especially the descriptive output.  Conclusions The LLM chatbot evaluated in this study mixed incorrect cancer treatment recommendations with correct recommendations, which even experts failed to detect these mistakes. Accordingly, 33.33% of its treatment recommendations were at least partially non-concordant with NCCN guidelines.   The study findings demonstrate that the LLM chatbot was associated with below-average performance in providing reliable and precise cancer treatment recommendations.  Due to the increasingly widespread use of AI, it is crucial for healthcare providers to appropriately educate their patients about the potential misinformation that this technology can provide. These findings also emphasize the importance of federal regulations for AI and other technologies that have the potential to cause harm to the general public due to their inherent limitations and inappropriate use.

A year ago, this was just about the most common-sense rule on Earth. Today, it’s laughably naïve.  There’s a remarkable disconnect between how professors and administrators think students use generative AI on written work and how we actually use it. Many assume that if an essay is written with the help of ChatGPT, there will be some sort of evidence — it will have a distinctive “voice,” it won’t make very complex arguments, or it will be written in a way that AI-detection programs will pick up on. Those are dangerous misconceptions. In reality, it’s very easy to use AI to do the lion’s share of the thinking while still submitting work that looks like your own. Once that becomes clear, it follows that massive structural change will be needed if our colleges are going to keep training students to think critically.  The common fear among teachers is that AI is actually writing our essays for us, but that isn’t what happens. You can hand ChatGPT a prompt and ask it for a finished product, but you’ll probably get an essay with a very general claim, middle-school-level sentence structure, and half as many words as you wanted. The more effective, and increasingly popular, strategy is to have the AI walk you through the writing process step by step. You tell the algorithm what your topic is and ask for a central claim, then have it give you an outline to argue this claim. Depending on the topic, you might even be able to have it write each paragraph the outline calls for, one by one, then rewrite them yourself to make them flow better.  The common fear among teachers is that AI is actually writing our essays for us, but this isn’t what happens. As an example, I told ChatGPT, “I have to write a 6-page close reading of the Iliad. Give me some options for very specific thesis statements.” (Just about every first-year student at my university has to write a paper resembling this one.) Here is one of its suggestions: “The gods in the Iliad are not just capricious beings who interfere in human affairs for their own amusement but also mirror the moral dilemmas and conflicts that the mortals face.” It also listed nine other ideas, any one of which I would have felt comfortable arguing. Already, a major chunk of the thinking had been done for me. As any former student knows, one of the main challenges of writing an essay is just thinking through the subject matter and coming up with a strong, debatable claim. With one snap of the fingers and almost zero brain activity, I suddenly had one.  FROM THE CHRONICLE STORE College as a Public Good - Chronicle Report: People spreading seeds on a farm against the backdrop of a college building. REPORT  College as a Public Good Making the case through community engagement Visit the Store My job was now reduced to defending this claim. But ChatGPT can help here too! I asked it to outline the paper for me, and it did so in detail, providing a five-paragraph structure and instructions on how to write each one. For instance, for “Body Paragraph 1: The Gods as Moral Arbiters,” the program wrote: “Introduce the concept of the gods as moral arbiters in the Iliad. Provide examples of how the gods act as judges of human behavior, punishing or rewarding individuals based on their actions. Analyze how the gods’ judgments reflect the moral codes and values of ancient Greek society. Use specific passages from the text to support your analysis.” All that was left now was for me to follow these instructions, and perhaps modify the structure a bit where I deemed the computer’s reasoning flawed or lackluster.  The vital takeaway here is that it’s simply impossible to catch students using this process, and that for them, writing is no longer much of an exercise in thinking. The problem isn’t with a lack of AI-catching technology — even if we could definitively tell whether any given word was produced by ChatGPT, we still couldn’t prevent cheating. The ideas on the paper can be computer-generated while the prose can be the student’s own. No human or machine can read a paper like this and find the mark of artificial intelligence.  When we want students to learn how to think, assignments become essentially useless once AI gets involved. There are two possible conclusions. One is that we should embrace the role AI is beginning to play in the writing process. “So what that essays are easier to write now? AI is here for good; students might as well learn to use it.” Of course, it’s important to learn to put together a cohesive piece of written work, so it makes perfect sense to embrace AI on assignments that are meant to teach this skill. In fact, it would be counterproductive not to: If a tool is useful and widely available, students should learn how to use it. But if this is our only takeaway, we neglect the essay’s value as a method for practicing critical thinking. When we want students to learn how to think — something I’m sure all educators consider a top priority — assignments become essentially useless once AI gets involved.  So rather than fully embracing AI as a writing assistant, the reasonable conclusion is that there needs to be a split between assignments on which using AI is encouraged and assignments on which using AI can’t possibly help. Colleges ought to prepare their students for the future, and AI literacy will certainly be important in ours. But AI isn’t everything. If education systems are to continue teaching students how to think, they need to move away from the take-home essay as a means of doing this, and move on to AI-proof assignments like oral exams, in-class writing, or some new style of schoolwork better suited to the world of artificial intelligence.  As it stands right now, our systems don’t accomplish either of those goals. We don’t fully lean into AI and teach how to best use it, and we don’t fully prohibit it to keep it from interfering with exercises in critical thinking. We’re at an awkward middle ground where nobody knows what to do, where very few people in power even understand that something is wrong. At any given time, I can look around my classroom and find multiple people doing homework with the help of ChatGPT. We’re not being forced to think anymore.  People worry that ChatGPT might “eventually” start rendering major institutions obsolete. It seems to me that it already has.

"What will you be doing only a decade from now when advanced versions of the artificial intelligence program ChatGPT have wormed their way into the fabric of life?  According to some experts, you may be out of a job. Two current labour disputes involving autoworkers and screenwriters are at least partly about the future threat of AI.  When AI comes for the jobs, writers may be among the first to go, warn two respected technology mavens writing in Foreign Affairs magazine. And they are not alone in that view. Even current versions of the AI program ChatGPT can sketch clearer prose than most humans, they say. And those programs are getting better.   By 2035, as ""white-collar workers lose their jobs en masse,"" declare Ian Bremmer and Mustafa Suleyman, AI will be running hospitals and airlines and courtrooms. ""A year ago, that scenario would have seemed purely fictional; today, it seems nearly inevitable.""  Thumb-twiddling time? For Bremmer and Suleyman, job losses are a relatively mundane result of the AI revolution. Their ultimate concern is nothing less than the usurping of government power by intelligent machines and those who control them.  But will massive numbers of writers and lawyers and stockbrokers and coders and office workers really be sent home to twiddle their thumbs in a little over 10 years? There are many thoughtful skeptics who say there are really good reasons why that just won't happen. And at the core of it all, they say, is our unique humanity.  Peeking 10 years into the future leaks into the realm of science fiction, and those who imagine the future — while sometimes offering useful warnings — can easily get things wrong. Viewing the 1968 movie 2001: A Space Odyssey is a good reminder.  Douglas Trumbull was the industry pioneer behind the special effects of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Blade Runner. The 1968 movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, where humans interact with murderous artificial intelligence, is a reminder that those who imagine the future can get things wrong. (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) ""Anyone who says they can tell you that they can predict what's going to happen is either deluded or lying,"" said Canadian science fiction writer Karl Schroeder, who has written about AI in his novel Stealing Worlds and the short story The Suicide of our Troubles.  There is a certain irony in the comment, since Schroeder is also a professional futurist helping companies prepare for what may be around the corner.  Federal government issues new rules for public servants using AI He is convinced there is a value in using imagination to frame the possible extent of the AI problem as it becomes better at human tasks.  ""It isn't any different from the question of what to do with the jackhammer when you're the guy with the pickaxe,"" Schroeder said.   Essential human skills The lack of certainty over how AI will develop — and how quickly — means its eventual impact is open to infinite speculation, he said. As governments around the world consider how to regulate it, the unknowable nature of what AI will become is just one of many complications.  But unless intelligent machines grow into evil geniuses that decide to crush us like bugs, said Schroeder and everyone else I talked to, there is one certainty in the future relationship between humans and machines, and that is humanity.  A nurse tends to a patient in a hospital. AI can help alleviate nursing shortages — not by replacing nurses, but by handling boring and repetitive tasks so nurses can do jobs that machines can't. (Chris Young/The Canadian Press) ""Much of what we do as humans, even though we have our official job titles, goes outside of the official job descriptions,"" said AJung Moon, who teaches computer engineering at McGill University in Montreal.  While the artificial intelligence and robotics expert sees various portions of jobs being stolen away by smart software, as that happens, she said, humans will do more of the things AI isn't so good at.  AI shows major promise in breast cancer detection, new studies suggest In her own job teaching university students, she sees AI taking away the boring, bureaucratic and redundant parts of the work, leaving her more time for the kind of human interaction that leads to student success.  ""What is their learning journey like? What is their life like?"" Moon said. ""I can actually get to more forming of connections with my students.""  Things robots cannot do As someone who has been working at the leading edge of robotics for more than a decade, Moon said a lot of work humans do is in no danger from AI. Hands-on human finesse, the ""haptic feedback"" of human touch, fine motor skills, the ability to switch abruptly from gentle care and stroking to heavy tasks, or figuring out how to fix old piping in an old house — ""that is impossible right now.""  Despite the imminent arrival of devices like Elon Musk's Optimus robot, Moon said she doesn't see AI changing that any time soon, meaning that the many jobs that require human judgment, instant decisions and human dexterity will continue to need humans.  ANALYSISChatGPT may reset the world of work as businesses rush to own artificial intelligence ANALYSISYes, computers really are taking jobs from humans — especially in banking: Don Pittis In a hospital, for example, artificial intelligence can count the pills, do the paperwork and help create efficiencies in treatment. The advantage is that it will leave more time for tasks where humanity remains indispensable.  That essential humanity entailing not just what we do and how we do it, but the reasons for doing it, is encapsulated in a concept called ""human centricity."" It is an approach at the core of work by anthropologist Paul Hartley, CEO of the Toronto-based Human Futures Studio, a kind of management consultancy that has helped tech companies from going off track.  LISTEN | Meet ChatGPT, the AI program that can code, create essays and write poetry:   Day 610:21 Meet ChatGPT, the free AI chatbot that's blowing people's minds ChatGPT is a free AI chatbot that appears to be a huge improvement on any chatbot that has come before in terms of fluency, usefulness and resistance to the effects of being spammed with hateful content. In the short time since its release, it has delivered accurate computer code, decent poetry and above average high school essays, all with just a few text prompts. ""It's an articulation of how to keep people really at the centre,"" he said.  Hartley, author of the book Radical Human Centricity, said the concept predates recent thinking about AI, growing out of notions about ""user experience,"" or ""UX,"" in the technology sector where tech geeks might be tempted to wander off into the never-never land of technology for technology's sake.  In some science fiction future, AI may eventually be able to think for itself and find its own motivations that are incomprehensible to us. But until that time, no matter how advanced, AI will remain a tool for use by humans for human purposes, Hartley said.

With no single jurisdiction and unknown capacity, AI is hard to regulate. (Amir Cohen/Reuters) The essential lesson of human centricity is that technology and software tools, including AI, have no purpose if they fail to respond to human needs.  The requirements of humanity, insists Vurain Tabvuma, a professor at the Sobey School of Business at St. Mary's University in Halifax who has collaborated with Hartley, are also at the heart of why human work will never be supplanted by AI.  Get the news you need without restrictions. Download our free CBC News App. Even after it becomes ubiquitous in a decade or so, Tabvuma said he foresees AI as being similar to previous technological advances that, in theory, killed jobs. Human librarians used to bring him books and articles. Now he gets them online.  Machines replaced weavers. Rooms of typists and calculators have been replaced by email and spreadsheet software. Robots have been taking the place of humans on assembly lines and in warehouses for years. But none of those changes have reduced the amount of work people do. Unemployment has never been so low, and many of us seem busier than ever.  WATCH | Students who turn to AI face penalties, universities warn:  Universities warn of penalties as students increasingly turn to AI 16 days ago Duration2:30 University students are getting ready to hit the books, take notes and write essays. At least that's how academic leaders hope they'll approach their studies, in the age of artificial intelligence — or AI. Capitalism to the rescue Reminiscent of the prediction by economist John Maynard Keynes in his 1930 essay Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren that by now we would be working 15-hour weeks, Tabvuma thinks we probably won't have a chance to put our feet up this time, either.  Some have warned that the capitalist economy will use AI against human workers, but he said that history shows the capitalist free market will guarantee future work because it will keep finding new ways to use human talent and resources. Tabvuma's analysis echoes a statement by tech entrepreneur Jack O'Holleran in an essay earlier this month.  ""If AI can do 10 times the work of a coder, the majority of companies won't fire nine of their 10 software engineers,"" O'Holleran wrote. ""They're just going to [expand to] 100 times the amount of output they can produce with their current team of 10.""  Robots weld the bodyshell of a Toyota Camry Hybrid car on the assembly line at the Toyota plant in Melbourne August 31, 2009. The pilot production of the first Australian-built hybrid car has been officially launched in Melbourne today. The government has backed the project with $35 million Australian dollars ($29.4 million) to support Toyota's plans to make 10,000 Camry hybrids each year from 2010 at the Altona assembly plant from 2010. REUTERS/Mick Tsikas (AUSTRALIA TRANSPORT ENVIRONMENT BUSINESS) Robots have been taking jobs on auto assembly lines since the 1960s — in this case welding the bodyshell of a Toyota Camry at a Toyota plant in 2009. (Mick Tsikas/Reuters) Tabvuma said it is in the nature of the capitalist economy — the constant renewal known as ""creative destruction"" or ""churn,"" motivated by a search for profits — to repeatedly eliminate routinized work and use the resources saved in that process to create new work. AI will not stop that process, he said.  ""Over time companies will identify an opportunity, and over time they will start working to make the most of that opportunity,"" Tabvuma said.   ANALYSISCanadian artificial intelligence leader Geoffrey Hinton piles on fears of computer takeover And the process does not just happen in a corporate setting. Tabvuma talks to his students about the history of art and artisans going back to Greek and Roman times. On the surface, it appears that techniques for creating posters and painting using printing and photography and then computers have been progressively replacing the skills of human artisans.  ""It moves away from people and firmly into the realm of technology,"" Tabvuma said. But that has not eliminated artists, he said: ""You look at it right now in history? We have never had more artists in the world.""  Human replacement or human helpers Tabvuma also rejects the idea that a single corporate entity will take hold of artificial intelligence and use it to concentrate wealth and power and dominate humanity. For one thing, while it is now new and expensive, AI will become cheap and widely available to a new generation that understands how to use it. He said it will be hard for any business or sector to corner the market.  ""Some of these ideas are advocated by people who believe that the world we live in is a constant and that the businesses we see are always constant, but in capitalist economies, the businesses we interact with right now are not going to exist 10 years from now, or 20 or 30 years from now,"" Tabvuma said. At some point, companies like Facebook and Amazon and Apple are going to fail, he said.  Bird-watchers with cameras. Birders in New Brunswick chase their elusive prey. Technology like cameras may have displaced some artists, but there are still plenty of artists and many more photographers. (Submitted by Alain Clavette) ""There will be other companies that come up, and if they're coming up, they will employ people and expand their workforce, improve their technology and gain market share.""  And as for the work of writers offering you something you actually want to read? Tabvuma said as well as manual dexterity, humans have another big advantage.  EDITOR'S NOTEHow CBC News will manage the challenge of AI ""Think of the interaction you and I are having right now, the fact that you thought of 'How am I going to write this new article? I'm going to reach out to these people and interview them, and then out of that process. I'm going to write this article,'"" Tabvuma said.  ""And that is not physical dexterity, it's mental dexterity."""
https://medium.com/geekculture/making-chatgpt-smarter-today-537b59064c13	Making ChatGPT Smarter, Today	ChatGPT is everywhere right now. And for good reason.  It is really impressive.  Some might call it intelligent.  Some might call it conscious (it’s not.)  But the interesting question to ask is:  How intelligent is ChatGPT? How does it get more intelligent?   Me asking ChatGPT to answer this question. Article over, thanks AI! According to Gary Marcus, there are a some core competencies of Intelligence that ChatGPT lacks (for now):  Structured Knowledge Deep Understanding I’ll cover both these topics, with examples of each concept already existing in the AI community today, and how ChatGPT be upgraded to account for these concepts.  Hope you enjoy 🚀  1. Structured Knowledge One core distinction between today’s Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence is that AI does not explicitly “model” the world — Neural Networks like the ones powering ChatGPT are trained to guess words in a sentence, and through this learn this process learn about the world, rather than learn structured facts or information about the world.  So far, it has worked out pretty well for the AI community to do it this way.  However, we can criticize this strategy as a creating approximate knowledge, rather than actual knowledge itself.   ChatGPT doesn’t actually know anything, it just is good at guessing. Photo by Gabriella Clare Marino on Unsplash Approximate Knowledge: ChatGPT does not “know” anything, as far as we know. It can mimic human speech in a wide variety of domains, but can’t apply any sort of intelligent logic to situations. And because of this, it sometimes makes hilarious and incredibly unintelligent mistakes:

https://www.npr.org/2023/08/30/1196777528/an-ai-quadcopter-has-beaten-human-champions-at-drone-racing	An AI quadcopter has beaten human champions at drone racing	"Today researchers in Switzerland unveiled a small drone powered by artificial intelligence that can outfly some of the best human competitors in the world.  A quadcopter drone equipped with an AI brain whipped its way around an indoor race course in a matter of seconds. In 15 out of 25 races it was able to beat its human rival, according to research published today in the journal Nature.  ""This is the first time that an AI has challenged and beaten human champions in a real-world competitive sport,"" says Elia Kaufmann, an autonomy engineer at Skydio, a drone company based out of Redwood City, California, who worked on the drone while at the University of Zurich in Switzerland.  Achievement Unlocked: Google AlphaGo A.I. Wins Go Series, 4-1 THE TWO-WAY Achievement Unlocked: Google AlphaGo A.I. Wins Go Series, 4-1 Computers have been beating humans at their own games for quite a while now. In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue bested Garry Kasparov at chess. In 2016 Google built a program using artificial intelligence that could beat world champion Lee Sedol at the game of Go. AI programs have also bested humans at poker and several video games.   Using reinforcement learning, the drone (blue) taught itself a faster way around the course than its human opponent (red). Leonard Bauersfeld But every one of these competitions has taken place on a board or at a desk. The computers haven't been able to beat people in real-world competitions. Kaufmann says that's because it's much harder to simulate real-world conditions if you're flying a drone than if you're playing a game on a board. ""This is called the sim-to-real gap,"" he says.  Bet On The Bot: AI Beats The Professionals At 6-Player Texas Hold 'Em SCIENCE Bet On The Bot: AI Beats The Professionals At 6-Player Texas Hold 'Em The team overcame the gap using a variety of AI and conventional programing strategies. Kaufmann taught the drone what racing gates looked like by hand-identifying the fabric gates in tens of thousands of images — a technique known as ""supervised learning."" The team also used more conventional code to help the drone triangulate its position and orientation based on visual cues from its cameras.  But the real secret to the drone's success came from a relatively new technique known as ""reinforcement learning."" The team put the drone's control code into a virtual version of the race course and sent it around and around in virtual space for the equivalent of 23 days (one hour of computing time). The code kept practicing until it learned the best route.   University of Zurich YouTube ""That means as fast as possible, and also all gates in the correct sequence,"" says Leonard Bauersfeld, a Ph.D. student at the robotics and perception group at the University of Zurich.  The final version of the code allowed the drone to best its human rivals 60% of the time.  The drone has plenty of limitations. It only works for the specific course it's been trained on and in a specific environment. Moving the course from inside to outdoors, for example, would throw the drone off due to changes in lighting. And the slightest things can send it spinning. For example, if a rival accidentally bumps it, ""it has no idea how to handle this and crashes,"" says Bauersfeld.  Bauersfeld says that lack of flexibility is part of the reason this kind of technology can't be easily fashioned into a killer military drone anytime soon.  In an accompanying commentary in Nature, Guido de Croon, a researcher at Delft University in the Netherlands says that the new technology has a way to go.  ""To beat human pilots in any racing environment, the drone will have to deal with external disturbances such as the wind as well as with changing light conditions, gates that are less clearly defined, other racing drones and many other factors,"" he writes.  Still, the little drone does show that AI is ready to make that jump from the virtual world into the real one — regardless of whether its human opponents are ready or not."
https://federalnewsnetwork.com/air-force/2023/09/study-finds-major-shortcomings-in-air-force-processes-to-test-ai-technologies/	Study finds major shortcomings in Air Force processes to test AI technologies	The Air Force has big ambitions for incorporating artificial intelligence into warfighting. But there’s one big problem: As of now, the service doesn’t have the processes or infrastructure to test and evaluate AI with nearly the same rigor it’s long used and demanded for its less intelligent weapons systems.  That assessment is one of the key findings of a more than year-long study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NAS), whose authors emphasized the challenges in assessing whether an AI-enabled system will work as it’s intended are not unique to the Air Force, but rather, are common across federal agencies.  One of the biggest challenges the Air Force faces is that its test and evaluation infrastructure is designed to put physical weapons systems through their paces at defined points in time, before they’ve been fielded. In that process, once a bomber or fighter has been deemed suitable and effective for its missions, it’s turned over to the operational community.  But that’s simply not how AI works, said May Casterline, a co-chair of the committee that conducted the study at the Air Force’s request. Instead, testing and evaluation has to keep happening for as long as the system is being employed in the real world.          Insight by Red Hat: Join us for an enlightening panel discussion with moderator, Justin Doubleday and agency and industry leaders who will explore the strategies and tools aimed at empowering the modern digital-native workforce in the intelligence community.  “AI constantly needs to be retrained with new data that it sees out in the field. It responds and changes to what you’re asking it to do by being retrained with new data in a continuous retraining cycle, and you really want that to happen at the pace at which things are changing on the ground,” Casterline, who is also a data scientist at Nvidia, said in an interview with Federal News Network. “You have to have a test infrastructure that can keep up with that pace, but the current approach is much more serial, with defined milestones that take longer timelines to execute. And you just will not be able to adapt to the changes in operations as fast as you would like using those mechanisms.”  The recognition of the need to treat AI differently for testing and evaluation purposes isn’t strictly new. The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence also cautioned in its final 2021 report that DoD would need to adapt its approaches “so that when AI systems are composed into systems-of-systems their interaction does not lead to unexpected negative outcomes.”  But the NAS study emphasizes that producing test results officials can feel confident about will require sweeping changes across the Air Force’s test and evaluation infrastructure, including more funding to model and simulate how algorithms might behave when they encounter new data, new ways to curate and collect that data into the T&E “pipeline,” a major emphasis on understanding human-machine interfaces in the military context, and developing a workforce that understands how to test and employ AI models.  And none of that is likely to happen unless the Air Force appoints a very senior official — a “champion,” as the study puts it — who has the authority to lead those changes. That person needs to be a general officer or senior executive, the NAS panel found.  “The original questions the Air Force asked us to study were fairly narrow, but it turns out that T&E is so pervasive that when you really start to pick apart the implications of testing, evaluation and operationalizing AI, you realize how many places within the department will have to get involved and change and modify,” Casterline said. “So you really need a single person who has the responsibilities, authorities and liabilities to add rigor to the T&E approaches across the department.”  The NAS study found the Air Force and the broader DoD can likely learn lessons from the commercial sector. After all, it’s not as though no one’s tried to incorporate real-world operational data into a continuous testing and improvement cycle. Automakers, for example, are doing that right now with AI-enabled safety-critical systems with an approach sometimes called “AIOps,” similar in concept to the DevSecOps philosophy that’s used for continuous security improvements in software.  But there are major differences in the Defense space that keep those approaches from mapping directly onto military systems, so to a large extent, the Air Force and the rest of DoD will need to reinvent their testing and evaluation infrastructure to deal with the AI challenge, the authors found.  “Commercial industry has solved a lot of the technology hurdles that are going to be required. There are core components and practices that can be looked at as parts of the blueprint, and there are examples of AIOps in industry,” Casterline said. “But there are areas where DoD-specific deployments start to break that model.”          Read more: Air Force  For instance, the kinds of data an AI-enabled system might ingest in the real world are likely to be in parts of the globe where it’s not easy to simply upload them to central location for further analysis, like a commercial company might.  “That breaks with sort of the traditional commercial model that backhauls everything to a cloud, perhaps, and does it all in house. The next place it gets challenging, is that there are really extreme size, weight and power constraints that are very unique to DoD because of the ruggedization and environmental conditions. There are also a lot of security requirements. And there’s also a lot of bespoke phenomenology that has to be modeled to really create the simulation capability to deal with edge cases and retraining of these models for rare events. You won’t get that from commercial, but you can certainly look at them as an example and then have the department and the industrial base invest in those gaps to make that model work within the [defense] ecosystem.”

But there are major differences in the Defense space that keep those approaches from mapping directly onto military systems, so to a large extent, the Air Force and the rest of DoD will need to reinvent their testing and evaluation infrastructure to deal with the AI challenge, the authors found.  “Commercial industry has solved a lot of the technology hurdles that are going to be required. There are core components and practices that can be looked at as parts of the blueprint, and there are examples of AIOps in industry,” Casterline said. “But there are areas where DoD-specific deployments start to break that model.”          Read more: Air Force  For instance, the kinds of data an AI-enabled system might ingest in the real world are likely to be in parts of the globe where it’s not easy to simply upload them to central location for further analysis, like a commercial company might.  “That breaks with sort of the traditional commercial model that backhauls everything to a cloud, perhaps, and does it all in house. The next place it gets challenging, is that there are really extreme size, weight and power constraints that are very unique to DoD because of the ruggedization and environmental conditions. There are also a lot of security requirements. And there’s also a lot of bespoke phenomenology that has to be modeled to really create the simulation capability to deal with edge cases and retraining of these models for rare events. You won’t get that from commercial, but you can certainly look at them as an example and then have the department and the industrial base invest in those gaps to make that model work within the [defense] ecosystem.”	Summary: Researchers unravel the mysteries of smell using machine learning. Their AI model has achieved human-level skill in describing how certain chemicals will smell, closing a critical gap in the scientific understanding of olfaction.  Beyond advancing our comprehension of smell, this technology could lead to breakthroughs in the fragrance and flavor industries, and even help create new functional scents like mosquito repellents. The study validates a first-of-its-kind data-driven map of human olfaction, which correlates chemical structure to odor perception.  Key Facts:  The AI model was trained using an industry dataset of 5,000 known odorants, enabling it to predict smell descriptors based on a molecule’s structure. Human panelists trained in the study, when compared to the AI model, found that the model outperformed individual human assessments for 53% of the molecules tested. The AI model also displayed capabilities it was not trained for, like accurately predicting the strength of odors, revealing its potential for broader olfactory tasks. Source: Monell Chemical Senses Center  A main crux of neuroscience is learning how our senses translate light into sight, sound into hearing, food into taste, and texture into touch.  Smell is where these sensory relationships get more complex and perplexing.   To address this question, a research team co-led by the Monell Chemical Senses Center and start-up Osmo, a Cambridge, Mass.-based company spun out of machine learning research done at Google Research, are investigating how airborne chemicals connect to odor perception in the brain.  To this end they discovered that a machine-learning model has achieved human-level proficiency at describing, in words, how chemicals might smell.  This shows a woman. The model was able to identify dozens of pairs of structurally dissimilar molecules that had counter-intuitively similar smells, and characterize a wide variety of odor properties, such as odor strength, for 500,000 potential scent molecules. Credit: Neuroscience News Their research appears in the September 1 issue of Science.  “The model addresses age-old gaps in the scientific understanding of the sense of smell,” said senior co-author Joel Mainland, PhD, Monell Center Member. This collaboration moves the world closer to digitizing odors to be recorded and reproduced. It also may identify new odors for the fragrance and flavor industry that could not only decrease dependence on naturally sourced endangered plants, but also identify new functional scents for such uses as mosquito repellent or malodor masking.   “How our brains and noses work together”  Humans have about 400 functional olfactory receptors. These are proteins at the end of olfactory nerves that connect with airborne molecules to transmit an electrical signal to the olfactory bulb. The number of olfactory receptors is much more than we use for color vision – four – or even taste – about 40.   “In olfaction research, however, the question of what physical properties make an airborne molecule smell the way it does to the brain has remained an enigma,” said Mainland. “But if a computer can discern the relationship between how molecules are shaped and how we ultimately perceive their odors, scientists could use that knowledge to advance the understanding of how our brains and noses work together.”  To address this, Osmo CEO Alex Wiltschko, PhD and his team created a model that learned how to match the prose descriptions of a molecule’s odor with the odor’s molecular structure. The resulting map of these interactions is essentially groupings of similarly smelling odors, like floral sweet and candy sweet.  “Computers have been able to digitize vision and hearing, but not smell – our deepest and oldest sense,” said Wiltschko. “This study proposes and validates a novel data-driven map of human olfaction, matching chemical structure to odor perception.”  What is the smell of garlic or of ozone?   The model was trained using an industry dataset that included the molecular structures and odor qualities of 5,000 known odorants. Data input is the shape of a molecule, and the output is a prediction of which odor words best describe its smell.   To ascertain the efficacy of the model, researchers at Monell conducted a blind validation procedure in which a panel of trained research participants described new molecules, and then compared their answers with the model’s description. The 15 panelists were each given 400 odorants as well as trained to use a set of 55 words – from mint to musty – to describe each molecule.   “Our confidence in this model can only be as good as our confidence in the data we used to test it,” said co-first author Emily Mayhew, PhD, who conducted this research while a Monell postdoctoral fellow. She is now an assistant professor at Michigan State University. Brian K. Lee, PhD, Google Research, Brain Team, Cambridge, Mass., is also a co-first author.   The Monell team supplied panelists with lab-designed odor reference kits to teach them how to recognize the smells and select the most appropriate words to describe their perception. To avoid pitfalls from past studies like panelist conflation of “musty,” like a wet basement, and “musky,” like a perfume, training sessions and lab-designed odor reference kits taught each panelist the odor quality associated with each descriptive term.  The panelists were asked to select which of the 55 descriptors applied and to rate the extent to which the term best applied to the odor on a 1-to-5 scale for each of the 400 odors. For example, one panelist rated the smell of the previously uncharacterized odorant 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5-carboxaldehyde as very powdery (5) and somewhat sweet (3).   Quality control is also important in the final comparison of the human sniffers to the computer model. That’s where co-author Jane Parker, PhD, Professor of Flavour Chemistry, University of Reading, UK comes in. “I’ve worked on smell for many years, relying mainly on my own nose to describe aromas.”  Her team verified the purity of samples used to test the model’s prediction. First, gas chromatography enabled them to separate out each compound in a sample, including any impurities. Next, Parker and her team smelled each separated compound to determine whether any impurity is overwhelming the target molecule’s known odor.  “We did find a few samples with significant impurities, among the 50 tested,” Parker said. In one case, the impurity was from traces of a reagent used in the synthesis of the target molecule and gave the sample a distinctive buttery smell that overpowered the odorant of interest. “In this case we were able to explain why the panel had described the smell differently to the AI prediction.”  Better Than a Human?  In comparing the model’s performance to that of individual panelists, the model achieved better predictions of the average of the group’s odor ratings than any single panelist in the study, impurities aside. Specifically, the model performed better than the average panelist for 53% of the molecules tested.   “The most surprising result, however, is that the model succeeded at olfactory tasks it was not trained to do,” said Mainland. “The eye-opener was that we never trained it to learn odor strength, but it could nonetheless make accurate predictions.”   The model was able to identify dozens of pairs of structurally dissimilar molecules that had counter-intuitively similar smells, and characterize a wide variety of odor properties, such as odor strength, for 500,000 potential scent molecules. “We hope this map will be useful to researchers in chemistry, olfactory neuroscience, and psychophysics as a new tool for investigating the nature of olfactory sensation,” said Mainland.   What’s next? The team surmises that the model map may be organized based on metabolism, which would be a fundamental shift in how scientists think about odors. In other words, odors that are close to each other on the map, or perceptually similar, are also more likely to be metabolically related. Sensory scientists currently organize molecules the way a chemist would, for example, asking does it have an ester or an aromatic ring?   “Our brains don’t organize odors in this way,” said Mainland. “Instead, this map suggests that our brains may organize odors according to the nutrients from which they derive.”   Funding: This research was funded in part by Google Research and National Institutes of Health grants F32 DC019030 and T32 DC000014.

Several high school sports reports written by an AI service called LedeAI and published by the Columbus Dispatch earlier this month went viral on social media this week — and not in a good way.  In one notable example, preserved by the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, the story began: “The Worthington Christian [[WINNING_TEAM_MASCOT]] defeated the Westerville North [[LOSING_TEAM_MASCOT]] 2-1 in an Ohio boys soccer game on Saturday.” The page has since been updated.  The reports were mocked on social media for being repetitive, lacking key details, using odd language and generally sounding like they’d been written by a computer with no actual knowledge of sports.  CNN identified several other local Gannett outlets, including the Louisville Courrier Journal, AZ Central, Florida Today and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, that have all published similar stories written by LedeAI in recent weeks.  Author Jane Friedman found several new books being sold under her name on Amazon, only she didn't write them — she suspects artificial intelligence did. Amazon removed the books after she alerted the company to the issue.  An author says AI is 'writing' unauthorized books being sold under her name on Amazon Many of the reports feature identical language, describing “high school football action,” noting when one team “took victory away from” another and describing “cruise-control” wins. In many cases, the stories also repeated the date of the games being covered multiple times in just a few paragraphs.  Gannett has paused its experiment with LedeAI in all of its local markets that had been using the service, according to the company. The pause was earlier reported by Axios.  “In addition to adding hundreds of reporting jobs across the country, we are experimenting with automation and AI to build tools for our journalists and add content for our readers,” a Gannett spokesperson said in a statement. “We are continually evaluating vendors as we refine processes to ensure all the news and information we provide meets the highest journalistic standards.”  LedeAI CEO Jay Allred expressed regret that articles produced for Gannett newspapers “included some errors, unwanted repetition and/or awkward phrasing,” adding that the company “immediately launched an around-the-clock effort to correct the problems and made the appropriate changes.”  “There were legitimate problems with the reports we produced and the feedback we received was valid,” Allred said in a statement to CNN. But, he added: “We believe content automation is part of the future of local newsrooms … Our service provides readers and communities with information they would not otherwise have, and frees reporters and editors to do real journalism that drives impact in the communities they serve.”  As of Wednesday, several Dispatch sports stories written by the service had been updated and appended with the note: “This AI-generated story has been updated to correct errors in coding, programming or style.”  The AI tool debacle comes after Gannett axed hundreds of jobs in December when it laid off 6% of its news division.  It also comes as many news outlets grapple with how to handle the rapid advancement of AI technology.  CNET earlier this year also paused an experiment using AI to write stories after it was forced to issue multiple corrections on AI-generated reports. Meanwhile, some other outlets have blocked access to software from OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, in an effort to prevent their content from being used to train its AI models.
https://www.deepmind.com/blog/identifying-ai-generated-images-with-synthid	Identifying AI-generated images with SynthID	AI-generated images are becoming more popular every day. But how can we better identify them, especially when they look so realistic?  Today, in partnership with Google Cloud, we’re launching a beta version of SynthID, a tool for watermarking and identifying AI-generated images. This technology embeds a digital watermark directly into the pixels of an image, making it imperceptible to the human eye, but detectable for identification.  SynthID is being released to a limited number of Vertex AI customers using Imagen, one of our latest text-to-image models that uses input text to create photorealistic images.   Generative AI technologies are rapidly evolving, and computer generated imagery, also known as ‘synthetic imagery’, is becoming harder to distinguish from those that have not been created by an AI system.   While generative AI can unlock huge creative potential, it also presents new risks, like enabling creators to spread false information — both intentionally or unintentionally. Being able to identify AI-generated content is critical to empowering people with knowledge of when they’re interacting with generated media, and for helping prevent the spread of misinformation.  We’re committed to connecting people with high-quality information, and upholding trust between creators and users across society. Part of this responsibility is giving users more advanced tools for identifying AI-generated images so their images — and even some edited versions — can be identified at a later date.    SynthID generates an imperceptible digital watermark for AI-generated images. Google Cloud is the first cloud provider to offer a tool for creating AI-generated images responsibly and identifying them with confidence. This technology is grounded in our approach to developing and deploying responsible AI, and was developed by Google DeepMind and refined in partnership with Google Research.  SynthID isn’t foolproof against extreme image manipulations, but it does provide a promising technical approach for empowering people and organisations to work with AI-generated content responsibly. This tool could also evolve alongside other AI models and modalities beyond imagery such as audio, video, and text.  New type of watermark for AI images Watermarks are designs that can be layered on images to identify them. From physical imprints on paper to translucent text and symbols seen on digital photos today, they’ve evolved throughout history.  Traditional watermarks aren’t sufficient for identifying AI-generated images because they’re often applied like a stamp on an image and can easily be edited out. For example, discrete watermarks found in the corner of an image can be cropped out with basic editing techniques.  Finding the right balance between imperceptibility and robustness to image manipulations is difficult. Highly visible watermarks, often added as a layer with a name or logo across the top of an image, also present aesthetic challenges for creative or commercial purposes. Likewise, some previously developed imperceptible watermarks can be lost through simple editing techniques like resizing.   The watermark is detectable even after modifications like adding filters, changing colours and brightness. We designed SynthID so it doesn't compromise image quality, and allows the watermark to remain detectable, even after modifications like adding filters, changing colours, and saving with various lossy compression schemes — most commonly used for JPEGs.   SynthID uses two deep learning models — for watermarking and identifying — that have been trained together on a diverse set of images. The combined model is optimised on a range of objectives, including correctly identifying watermarked content and improving imperceptibility by visually aligning the watermark to the original content.  Robust and scalable approach  SynthID allows Vertex AI customers to create AI-generated images responsibly and to identify them with confidence. While this technology isn’t perfect, our internal testing shows that it’s accurate against many common image manipulations.  SynthID's combined approach:  Watermarking: SynthID can add an imperceptible watermark to synthetic images produced by Imagen.‍ Identification: By scanning an image for its digital watermark, SynthID can assess the likelihood of an image being created by Imagen.  SynthID can help assess how likely it is that an image was created by Imagen.  This tool provides three confidence levels for interpreting the results of watermark identification. If a digital watermark is detected, part of the image is likely generated by Imagen.  SynthID contributes to the broad suite of approaches for identifying digital content. One of the most widely used methods of identifying content is through metadata, which provides information such as who created it and when. This information is stored with the image file. Digital signatures added to metadata can then show if an image has been changed.  When the metadata information is intact, users can easily identify an image. However, metadata can be manually removed or even lost when files are edited. Since SynthID’s watermark is embedded in the pixels of an image, it’s compatible with other image identification approaches that are based on metadata, and remains detectable even when metadata is lost.   What’s next? To build AI-generated content responsibly, we’re committed to developing safe, secure, and trustworthy approaches at every step of the way — from image generation and identification to media literacy and information security.  These approaches need to be robust and adaptable as generative models advance and expand to other mediums. We hope our SynthID technology can work together with a broad range of solutions for creators and users across society, and we’re continuing to evolve SynthID by gathering feedback from users, enhancing its capabilities, and exploring new features.   SynthID could be expanded for use across other AI models and we’re excited about the potential of integrating it into more Google products and making it available to third parties in the near future — empowering people and organisations to responsibly work with AI-generated content.  Note: The model used for producing synthetic images in this blog may be different from the model used on Imagen and Vertex AI.

Here, we use a eXplainable-AI (XAI) technique called inception or deep dreaming, which has been invented in machine learning for computer vision. We use this techniques to explore what neural networks learn about quantum optics experiments. Our story begins by training a deep neural networks on the properties of quantum systems. Once trained, we ""invert"" the neural network – effectively asking how it imagines a quantum system with a specific property, and how it would continuously modify the quantum system to change a property. We find that the network can shift the initial distribution of properties of the quantum system, and we can conceptualize the learned strategies of the neural network. Interestingly, we find that, in the first layers, the neural network identifies simple properties, while in the deeper ones, it can identify complex quantum structures and even quantum entanglement. This is in reminiscence of long-understood properties known in computer vision, which we now identify in a complex natural science task. Our approach could be useful in a more interpretable way to develop new advanced AI-based scientific discovery techniques in quantum physics. I. INTRODUCTION Neural networks have been demonstrably promising towards solving various tasks in quantum science [1–3]. One notorious frustration concerning neural networks, however, lays in their inscrutability: modern architectures often contain millions of trainable parameters, and it is not readily apparent what role that they each play in the network’s prediction. We may, therefore, inquire about what learned concepts from the data that the network utilizes to formulate its prediction, an important prerequisite in achieving scientific understanding [4]. This has since motivated the development of eXplainable-AI (XAI), which interprets how the network comes up with its solutions [5–8]. These developments have spurred physicists to address the problem of interpretability, resulting in the rediscovery of long-standing physics concepts [9, 10], the identification of phase transitions in quantum many-body physics [11–14], the compression of many-body quantum systems [15], and the study on the relationship between quantum systems and their entanglement properties [16, 17]. Here, we apply neural networks in the design of quantum optical experiments. The growing complexity of quantum information tasks has since motivated the design of computational methods capable of navigating the vast combintorical space of possible experimental designs that involve unintuitive phenomena [18]. To this end, scientists have developed automated design and machine learning routines [19], including some that leverage genetic algorithms [20, 21], active learning approaches [22] and the optimization of parameterized quantum cir- ∗ tjaou104@uottawa.ca † mario.krenn@mpl.mpg.de cuits [23–25]. One may inquire if we may be able to learn new physics from the discoveries made by such algorithms. For instance, the computer algorithm Melvin [19], which topologically searches for arrangements of optical elements, has led to the discovery of new concepts such as the generation of entanglement by path identity [26] and the creation of multipartite quantum gates [27]. However, the interpretability of these solutions is obfuscated by the stochasticity of the processes that create them as well as the unintuitiveness of their representations. The recent invention of Theseus [24], and its successor PyTheus [25] addresses this through the topological optimization of highly interpretable, graph-based representation of quantum optical experiments. This has already enabled new scientific discoveries, such as a new form of multi-photon interference [28], and novel experimental schemes for highdimensional quantum measurement [29]. To this point, the extraction and generalization of new concepts has largely been confined to analyzing the optimal solutions discovered by these algorithms. However, we may inquire if we can learn more physics by probing the rationale behind the computer’s discoveries. Little attention has hitherto been given towards the application of XAI techniques on neural networks trained on quantum experiments, which may allow us to conceptualize what our algorithm has learned. In so doing, we may guide the creation of AI-based design techniques for quantum experiments that are more reliable and interpretable. In this work, we present an interpretability tool based on the inceptionism technique in computer vision, better known as Deep Dreaming [30]. This technique has been applied to iteratively guide the automated design of quantum circuits [31] and molecules [32] towards optimizing a target property; it has also been applied in [33] arXiv:2309.07056v1 [quant-ph] 13 Sep 2023 2 to verify the reliability of a network trained to classify the entanglement spectra of many-body quantum systems. More importantly, it also lets us visualize what physical insights has the neural network gained from the training data. This lets us better discern the strategies applied throughout automated design processes, as well as to verify physical concepts rediscovered by the network, such as the thermodynamic arrow of time [34]. Here, we adapt this approach to quantum graphs. We train a deep neural network to predict properties of quantum systems, then inverse the training to optimize for a target property. We observe that the inverse training dramatically shifts the initial distribution of properties. We also show that, by visualizing the evolution of quantum graphs during inverse training, we are able to conceptualize the learned strategies applied by the neural network. We probe the network’s rationale further by inverse training on the intermediate layers of the network. We find that the network learns to recognize simple features in the first layers and then builds up more complicated structures in later layers. Altogether, we synthesize a complete picture of what the trained neural network sees. We, therefore, posit that our tool may aid the design of more interpretable and reliable computerinspired schemes to design quantum optics experiments. II. METHODOLOGY A. Graphs and Quantum Experiments FIG. 1. Brief overview of quantum graphs. In this work, we consider complete graph representations of twodimensional, quadripartite quantum graphs. We let ωa,b denote the weight of the edge connecting vertex a to vertex b. The weight’s magnitude is indicated by the transparency of the edge and the presence of a diamond signifies a negative edge weight. The creation of every possible state is conditioned on three possible types of perfect matchings, which are distinguished in terms of their direction. As developed in [24, 25, 35–37], we may represent quantum optical experiments in terms of colored, weighted, undirected multigraphs. This representation can be extended to integrated photonics [38–41] and entanglement by path identity [26, 42, 43]. The vertices of the graph represent photon paths to detectors, whereas edges between any two vertices, a and b, indicate correlation between two photon paths. We may assign an amplitude to them by introducing edge weights ωa,b, and we may assign the photons’ internal mode number through different edge colorings. We also permit multiple edges between the vertices to indicate the superposition of states. Here, we consider graph representations of four-qubit, two-dimensional experiments dealing with state creation. Specifically, we consider graphs with vertices V = {0, 1, 2, 3} and mode numbers 0 and 1. Each graph, therefore, consists of 24 possible edges with real-valued edge weights between 1 and -1. We may determine the particular quantum state |Φ(ω)⟩, where Φ(ω) is the graph’s weight function defined according to Eq. (2) in [25]. We condition the creation of each term in the state on subsets of edges which contains every vertex in the graph exactly once, otherwise known as the perfect matchings (PMs) of the graph. For each term, we can define three possible PMs, each distinguished by their ’directionality’, which we show in Figure 1. We obtain the amplitude of the term through the sum of weights of the three perfect matchings, which are themselves determined by the product of edge weights. Applying this procedure for every possible ket in the joint Hilbert space H = H2 ⊗ H2 ⊗ H2 ⊗ H2, we may obtain the state |Φ(ω)⟩. B. Training Figure 2 illustrates the basic workflow behind the dreaming process. A feed-forward neural network is first trained on the edge weights ω of a complete, quadripartite, two-dimensional quantum graph in order to make predictions on certain properties of the corresponding quantum state |Φ(ω)⟩. We randomly initialize ω over a uniform distribution [−1, 1]. The neural network’s own weights and biases are optimized for this task via mini-batch gradient descent and the mean squared error (MSE) loss function. We consider the state fidelity | ⟨Φ(ω)|ψ⟩ |2 with respect to two well-known classes of multipartite entangled states within the joint Hilbert space H. First, the GreenbergerHorne-Zeillinger (GHZ) State [44], |ψ⟩ = |GHZ⟩, where |GHZ⟩ = 1 √ 2 (|0000⟩ + |1111⟩), (1) and, second, the W-state [45], |ψ⟩ = |W⟩, where |W⟩ = 1 √ 2 (|1000⟩ + |0100⟩ + |0010⟩ + |0001⟩). (2) In addition, we also consider a measure of quantum state entanglement resulting from a graph – the concurrence [46]. Let A1, A2, A3, A4 each denote the subsystems of the joint quadripartite Hilbert space to which |Φ(ω)⟩ is defined. Then assuming the pure state 3 Prediction Network Inverse Training the Prediction Network is fixed (a) (b) Input hidden output predicted fidelity Random Quantum Graphs 1 0 2 3 Feed-Forward Back-Propagate Feed-Forward Back-Propagate Dreamed Quantum Graphs 1 0 2 3 1 0 2 3 ... maximize  the target FIG. 2. Quantum Graph Deep Dreaming. (a) The weights and biases of a feed-forward neural network are continually updated during training to predict a property such as fidelity of a given input random quantum experiment represented by a graph. (b) In the deep dreaming process, the weights and biases of the network are frozen. The weights of an initial input graph are updated iteratively to maximize the output of the feed-forward network, which gives the network’s prediction on the aforementioned property. ρ = |Φ(ω)⟩ ⟨Φ(ω)|, we may write C(ρ) = X M CM(ρ) = X M q 2( 1 − tr( ρ 2 M) ) (3) where M refers to a bipartition of the subsystem and tr( ρ 2 M) is the reduced density matrix obtained by tracing out M. In this work, we train our networks to make predictions on tr( ρ 2 M) . Furthermore, for all cases considered, the network is trained on examples with a property value below a threshold of 0.5 to ensure that the network is not memorizing the best solutions in each case. Once convergence in the training has been achieved, we then execute the deep dreaming protocol to extract insights on what the neural network has learned. Given an arbitrary input graph, we select a neuron in the trained neural network. Then, we maximize the neuron’s activation by updating the input graph via gradient ascent. In this stage, the weights and biases of the neural network are frozen, and we instead optimize for the edge weights of the input graph. At the end of the process, the graph mutates into a configuration which most excites the neuron. However, this may not entirely represent all that the neuron over-interprets from the input graph, as it has been shown in [47] that individual neurons can be trained to recognize various possible features of the input. Therefore, to uncover all that the neuron sees, we repeat this procedure over multiple different initializations. III. RESULTS A. Dreaming on the Output Layer Towards attaining a general idea of what the neural network has learned about select properties for the quantum state |Φ(ω)⟩, we first apply the deep dreaming approach on the output layer. Figure 3(a) illustrates the mutation of an input graph by applying the deep dreaming approach on a [4003 ,10] (three hidden layers of 400 neurons, one hidden layer of 10 neurons) neural network, which has been trained to predict either the GHZ-state or the W-state fidelity. We also apply this approach on a [8007 ] neural network architecture, which has been trained to predict the mean value of Tr"

AI	"Music fans responded with disbelief this week to the release on streaming and social media platforms of the viral song ""Heart on My Sleeve.""  The hosts of the popular music-related YouTube channel LawTWINZ were among the many who weighed in, discussing whether the track, which uses artificial intelligence to simulate the music of pop stars Drake and The Weeknd, even surpasses the real pop stars' talents.   YouTube Advances in AI have gotten to the point where the technology can quickly create new songs like ""Heart on My Sleeve"" that sound like they're the work of real artists.  Recent examples, which include a faux song that sounds a lot like something the British alt-rock band Oasis would put out, hint at AI's bold, creative possibilities and its ethical and legal limitations.  Now, artists, lawyers and other industry players are trying to figure out how the technology can be used responsibly.  'The cat is not going back in the bag' The popularity and revenue-earning potential of AI-generated songs have understandably put music industry gatekeepers on guard.  Drake and The Weeknd label owner Universal Music Group invoked copyright violation to get the platforms to take ""Heart on My Sleeve"" down this week.  ""The training of generative AI using our artists' music (which represents both a breach of our agreements and a violation of copyright law) as well as the availability of infringing content created with generative AI on DSPs [Demand Side Platforms], begs the question as to which side of history all stakeholders in the music ecosystem want to be on: the side of artists, fans and human creative expression, or on the side of deep fakes, fraud and denying artists their due compensation,"" said the company in a statement shared with NPR.  DALL-E is now available to all. NPR put it to work TECHNOLOGY DALL-E is now available to all. NPR put it to work This wasn't the first time the music corporation flexed its litigation muscles, and it won't be the last; earlier this month, it ordered a takedown of an AI track based on the music of Eminem. The song featured lyrics like, ""Cats, cats, cats, always on the prowl / They're sneaky and sly with their eyes on the goal.""  ""The cat is not going back in the bag,"" said Stanford University associate professor Ge Wang, of the growing popularity of AI-generated music online. Wang, who teaches a class on AI and music, said as the technology becomes more widespread, people can no longer afford to think of it as the stuff of science fiction.

https://futurism.com/the-byte/media-publisher-replaces-jobs-ai	MAJOR PUBLISHING HOUSE TO REPLACE HUNDREDS OF JOBS WITH AI	"Bild, the German tabloid owned and operated by major European publishing house Axel Springer, is expected to replace over a hundred human editorial jobs with artificial intelligence, a leaked email first obtained by the German paper Frankfurter Allgemeine (FAZ) has revealed.  The tabloid will ""unfortunately be parting ways with colleagues who have tasks that in the digital world are performed by AI and/or automated processes,"" the email reads, as reported by FAZ and translated by The Guardian.  According to the report, the email detailed that those who will be replaced by AI include ""editors, print production staff, subeditors, proofreaders and photo editors,"" and that these time-honored human careers ""will no longer exist as they do today.""  The decision appears to be part of broader cost-cutting efforts across Axel Springer brands, including Insider, which also cut a large chunk of employees amid its own AI pivot earlier this year.  Though several publications across the media industry have experimented with incorporating AI into their workflows, the choice to fully automate hundreds of essential editorial roles with AI feels like a significant escalation. Bild might be a messy, politicized tabloid, but Axel Springer is the biggest publisher in Europe and others could be following suit soon.  AI Fabrication The news comes after Axel Springer CEO Mathias Döpfner announced earlier this year that the company will turn into a ""purely digital media company"" and that AI will ""make independent journalism better than it ever was — or replace it.""  That said, there's still a chance the move could backfire on the publisher.  For one thing, as demonstrated earlier this year by BuzzFeed's quiet foray into extremely dull AI-spun travel guides, AI-generated text still tends to lack a sense of depth.  More importantly, generative AI tools are also notoriously unreliable and are known to consistently fabricate citations, quotes, and facts.  In short, it's unclear how an AI system could effectively replace anyone in the journalistic process, particularly when it comes to editing and proofreading.  What is clear, however, is that the move has been met with plenty of criticism already. In a statement to FAZ, the German Journalists' Association (DJV) condemned the automation effort as ""not just antisocial towards employees, but also extremely stupid economically."""
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-scientists-are-using-ai-to-talk-to-animals/	How Scientists Are Using AI to Talk to Animals	In the 1970s a young gorilla known as Koko drew worldwide attention with her ability to use human sign language. But skeptics maintain that Koko and other animals that “learned” to speak (including chimpanzees and dolphins) could not truly understand what they were “saying”—and that trying to make other species use human language, in which symbols represent things that may not be physically present, is futile.  “There's one set of researchers that's keen on finding out whether animals can engage in symbolic communication and another set that says, ‘That is anthropomorphizing. We need to understand nonhuman communication on its own terms,’” says Karen Bakker, a professor at the University of British Columbia and a fellow at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Now scientists are using improved sensors and artificial-intelligence technology to observe and decode how a broad range of species, including plants, already share information with their own methods. This field of “digital bioacoustics” is the subject of Bakker's 2022 book The Sounds of Life: How Digital Technology Is Bringing Us Closer to the Worlds of Animals and Plants (Princeton University Press).  Scientific American spoke with Bakker about how technology can help humans communicate with creatures such as bats and honeybees—and how these conversations are forcing us to rethink our relationship with other species.  [An edited transcript of the interview follows.]  Can you give us a brief history of humans attempting to communicate with animals?  There were numerous attempts in the mid-20th century to try to teach human language to nonhumans, primates such as Koko. And those efforts were somewhat controversial. As we look back, one view we have now (that may not have been so prevalent then) is that we were too anthropocentric in our approaches. The desire then was to assess nonhuman intelligence by teaching nonhumans to speak like we do—when in fact we should have been thinking about their abilities to engage in complex communication on their own terms, in their own embodied way, in their own worldview.  One of the terms used in the book is the notion of umwelt, which is this idea of the lived experience of organisms. If we are attentive to the umwelt of another organism, we wouldn't expect a honeybee to speak human language, but we would become very interested in the fascinating language of honeybees, which is vibrational and positional. It's sensitive to nuances such as the polarization of sunlight that we can't even begin to convey with our bodies. That is where the science is today. The field of digital bioacoustics—which is accelerating exponentially and unveiling fascinating findings about communication across the tree of life—is now approaching these animals and asking not “Can they speak like humans?” but “Can they communicate complex information to one another? How are they doing so? What is significant to them?” I would say that's a more biocentric approach, or at the very least it's less anthropocentric.  Taking a bigger view, I think it's also important to acknowledge that listening to nature, “deep listening,” has a long and venerable tradition. It's an ancient art that is still practiced in an unmediated form. There are long-standing Indigenous traditions of deep listening that are deeply attuned to nonhuman sounds. So if we combine digital listening—which is opening up vast new worlds of nonhuman sound and decoding that sound with artificial intelligence—with deep listening, I believe that we are on the brink of two important discoveries. The first is language in nonhumans. And that's a very controversial statement, which we can dig into. The second is: I believe we're at the brink of interspecies communication.  What kind of technology is enabling these breakthroughs?  Digital bioacoustics relies on very small, portable, lightweight digital recorders, which are like miniature microphones that scientists are installing everywhere from the Arctic to the Amazon. You can put these microphones on the backs of turtles or whales. You can put them deep in the ocean or on the highest mountaintop or attach them to birds. They can record continuously, 24/7, in remote places scientists cannot easily reach, even in the dark, and without the disruption that comes from introducing human observers in an ecosystem.  That instrumentation creates a data deluge, and that is where artificial intelligence comes in—because the same natural-language-processing algorithms that we are using to such great effect in tools such as Google Translate can also be used to detect patterns in nonhuman communication.  newsletter promo Sign up for Scientific American’s free newsletters.  Sign Up What's an example of these communication patterns?  In the bat chapter where I discuss the research of Yossi Yovel of Tel Aviv University, there's a particular study in which his team monitored [nearly two] dozen Egyptian fruit bats for two and a half months and recorded their vocalizations. They then adapted a voice-recognition program to analyze [15,000 of] the sounds, and the algorithm correlated specific sounds with specific social interactions captured via videos—such as when two bats fought over food. Using this, the researchers were able to classify the majority of bats' sounds. That is how Yovel and other researchers such as Gerry Carter of the Ohio State University have been able to determine that bats have much more complex language than we previously understood. Bats argue over food; they distinguish between genders when they communicate with one another; they have individual names, or “signature calls.” Mother bats speak to their babies in an equivalent of “motherese.” But whereas human mothers raise the pitch of their voices when talking to babies, mother bats lower the pitch—which elicits a babble response in the babies that learn to “speak” specific words or referential signals as they grow up. So bats engage in vocal learning.  That's a great example of how deep learning is able to derive these patterns from this instrumentation, all of these sensors and microphones, and reveal to us something that we could not access with the naked human ear. Because most of bat communication is in the ultrasonic, above our hearing range, and because bats speak much faster than we do, we have to slow it down to listen to it, as well as reduce the frequency. So we cannot listen like a bat, but our computers can. The next insight is that our computers can also speak back to the bat. The software produces specific patterns and uses those to communicate back to the bat colony or to the beehive, and that is what researchers are now doing.  How are researchers talking to bees?  The honeybee research is fascinating. A researcher named Tim Landgraf of Freie Universität Berlin studies bee communication, which, as I mentioned earlier, is vibrational and positional. When honeybees “speak” to one another, it's their body movements, as well as the sounds, that matter. Now computers, and particularly deep-learning algorithms, are able to follow this because you can use computer vision, combined with natural-language processing. They have now perfected these algorithms to the point where they're actually able to track individual bees, and they're able to determine what impact the communication of an individual might have on another bee. From that emerges the ability to decode honeybee language. We found that they have specific signals. Researchers have given these signals funny names. Bees toot; they quack. There's a “hush” or “stop” signal, a whooping “danger” signal. They've got piping [signals related to swarming] and begging and shaking signals, and those all direct collective and individual behavior.  The next step for Landgraf was to encode this information into a robot that he called RoboBee. Eventually, after seven or eight prototypes, he came up with a “bee” that could enter the hive, and it would essentially emit commands that the honeybees would obey. So Landgraf's honeybee robot can tell the other bees to stop, and they do. It can also do something more complicated, which is the very famous waggle dance—it's the communication pattern they use to convey the location of a nectar source to other honeybees. This is a very easy experiment to run, in a way, because you put a nectar source in a place where no honeybees from the hive have visited. You then instruct the robot to tell the honeybees where the nectar source is, and then you check whether the bees fly there successfully. And indeed, they do. This result happened only once, and scientists are not sure why it worked or how to replicate it. But it is still an astounding result.  This raises a lot of philosophical and ethical questions. You could imagine such a system being used to protect honeybees—you could tell honeybees to fly to safe nectar sources and not polluted ones that had, let's say, high levels of pesticides. You could also imagine this could be a tool to domesticate a previously wild species that we have only imperfectly domesticated or to attempt to control the behavior of other wild species. The insights about the level of sophistication and the degree of complex communication in nonhumans raise some very important philosophical questions about the uniqueness of language as a human capacity.  What impact is this technology having on our understanding of the natural world?  The invention of digital bioacoustics is analogous to the invention of the microscope. When Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek started looking through his microscopes, he discovered the microbial world, and that laid the foundation for countless future breakthroughs. So the microscope enabled humans to see anew with both our eyes and our imaginations. The analogy here is that digital bioacoustics, combined with artificial intelligence, is like a planetary-scale hearing aid that enables us to listen anew with both our prosthetically enhanced ears and our imagination. This is slowly opening our minds not only to the wonderful sounds that nonhumans make but to a fundamental set of questions about the so-called divide between humans and nonhumans, our relationship to other species. It's also opening up new ways to think about conservation and our relationship to the planet. It's pretty profound.

Scam artists are now using the technology to clone voices, including those of friends and family.  The disturbing trend is adding to mounting losses due to fraud. Americans lost nearly $9 billion to fraud last year alone – an increase of over 150% in just two years, according to the Federal Trade Commission.   The AI scam, which uses computer-generated voice, has left a trail of emotional devastation. Jennifer DeStefano, a mother, recounted during a U.S. Senate meeting her terrifying encounter with scammers who used the voice of her 15-year-old daughter, claiming they had her.   ""Mom, these bad men have me. Help me, help me, help me,"" DeStefano said she was told over the phone.   But her daughter was safe in her bed.   Kathy Stokes, the AARP director of fraud prevention, said younger people actually experience fraud and financial loss more often than older people, but it's the older generation who often have so much to lose.  Pete Nicoletti, a cyber security expert at Check Point Software Technologies, said common software can recreate a person's voice after just 10 minutes of learning it.   To protect against voice cloning scams, Nicoletti recommends families adopt a ""code word"" system and always call a person back to verify the authenticity of the call. Additionally, he advises setting social media accounts to private, as publicly available information can be easily used against individuals."
https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/why-ai-stocks-arent-in-a-bubble.html	Why AI stocks aren’t in a bubble	The explosion of interest in artificial intelligence this year has fueled a major rally in technology stocks, with a concentrated group of large US companies leading the market higher. This slate of “early winners,” including makers of semiconductors needed to build AI technology and cloud service providers with the computing infrastructure to commercialize it, returned roughly 60% through the first eight months of 2023, according to Goldman Sachs Research.    Even as those stocks have rallied substantially, they don’t appear to be in a bubble, Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist in Goldman Sachs Research, writes in the team’s report. The valuations of the stocks leading the market are not as stretched as in previous periods, such as the internet bubble that collapsed in 2000, and the companies have unusually strong balance sheets and returns on investment. “We believe we are still in the relatively early stages of a new technology cycle that is likely to lead to further outperformance,” Oppenheimer writes.  Technology stock valuations have climbed this year despite the impact of rising rates. This is in sharp contrast to 2022, when the sector’s sensitivity to rising discount rates depressed valuations, and it suggests investors are assuming much higher future growth rates for these companies.   US technology sector valuations, meanwhile, have developed an unusual premium relative to technology companies in Europe. This shows how important the AI narrative has been to the market’s gains, given that most of the leading companies in this area are US-based.    But the rally has been concentrated. Just 15 companies accounted for more than 90% of the returns of the S&P 500 Index from January through June. “Since many of these early winners are very large companies, the concentration of returns in the equity market this year has been extraordinarily high,” Oppenheimer notes.    This has naturally raised questions about a potential bubble and the possible implications of the concentrated market leadership.  Are tech stock valuations too high? Technology sector valuations are certainly high by historic standards, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Compared with the 10-year median and range, the current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the US technology sector is right at the top. But that’s not the whole story. The seven biggest US companies seen as leaders in the race to commercialize generative AI technology have an average P/E of 25. That compares with a P/E of 52 for the biggest companies at the peak of the internet bubble. The leading companies in the “Nifty 50” bubble of the late 1960s had a P/E over 34.  The US market as a whole is also at the top of its 10-year range for valuation, but this is being driven by the tech leaders. When large technology companies are excluded, the market’s valuation looks more in line with historical levels. What’s more, the biggest companies in Europe, not all of which are in technology, have a much lower valuation than the equivalent list of dominant companies in Europe during the tech bubble of the late 1990s. “Not only are the leading tech companies less extreme in valuation today, but the broader optimism that spilled over into equity valuations in the late 1990s is not apparent today,” Oppenheimer writes.  There’s more to contrast today’s AI-related stock market excitement to the exuberance of the internet stock bubble. Long-term growth expectations for the US technology sector have increased recently, but they remain well below the expected growth rates implied in the late 1990s.  And the current crop of technology leaders are already very profitable and generate cash, meaning they are investing at a high rate even in an environment of elevated interest rates and borrowing costs. Their cash as a percentage of market capitalization is double what companies had during the internet bubble. Their return on equity and average margins are also nearly double what was seen during the 1990s runup. “This has made these companies relatively defensive in terms of their revenues and earnings,” Oppenheimer notes. These companies are increasing their “moats” and raising the prospects for future growth.  To be sure, history provides numerous examples of technology waves that spur investor interest and exuberance and then inflate a bubble that eventually bursts — from canal stocks in the 1790s to internet stocks in the 1990s. A study that looked at 51 major tech innovations from 1825 to 2000 found investment bubbles were evident in 73% of the cases.  From that history of technology cycles, though, it’s possible to see patterns and common characteristics. After speculation builds and a bubble inflates and deflates, “the technology tends to re-emerge as a principal driver in the stock market,” Oppenheimer writes. Secondary innovations emerge, creating new companies and products; other industries are disrupted by the innovations, forcing incumbents to either adapt or recede.   A framework for classifying in AI stocks Examining the characteristics of prior waves of technological innovation — and the investment bubbles that often came with the change — can be helpful to understand current investment in AI-related stocks and future opportunities.  Oppenheimer says the PEARLs framework based on historical patterns may help investors think about how AI technology may create winners and losers in business and in the stock market. It divides companies into five groups: Pioneers, Enablers, Adapters, Reformers, and Laggards.  Pioneers are the innovators, and they include the early winners. “While the pioneers may be easiest to identify early on, they are not always the biggest beneficiaries,” Oppenheimer writes. New entrants may be nimbler. New innovations may emanate from the original technological advances, creating a later class of pioneers.   Enablers facilitate the innovators and help to commercialize the technology. These companies are also easy to spot early. What’s harder to know is how they will fare longer-term, Oppenheimer notes. In the internet buildout, telecom companies were enablers that mostly failed to justify inflated valuations, while semiconductor companies did better, in part because large capital investments helped to create barriers to entry.  Adapters are companies in other industries that change their business models to use the new technology effectively. With the spread of generative AI solutions, we may see big winners among companies that can adopt AI to improve healthcare or educations services, for example. “Many of the benefits may accrue to consumers in the form of cheaper new services,” Oppenheimer writes.  Reformers are typically new market entrants unencumbered by legacy costs. Think of online retailers, car-sharing apps, and online banks. “Such companies can disrupt a mature non-technology industry by utilizing the innovations to create a new business model that is more scalable than those of existing competitors,” Oppenheimer writes.  Laggards may have a dominant incumbent position in an industry, but, for whatever reason, react slowly and fail to keep up with new innovations. Going back to an earlier period of technological change for examples, we can point to photography companies that built strong incumbent positions based on their own innovation and then lost it all when digital photography displaced them.   While the success and eventual impact of an innovation can’t be known at the outset, Oppenheimer says the PEARLs framework can help investors focus on the companies that may be most likely to succeed over the long run.  For now, as investors weigh the potential for new AI technology and look for a way to share in the gains, they may spread investments across multiple companies as options on their future success. This has happened in the past, adding to the tendency to push the total valuation of companies exposed to a new technology to a level that exceeds the growth that can be generated — and creating bubbles. Despite the enthusiasm around AI, Oppenheimer suggests there’s little evidence of that happening so far.

https://www.securityweek.com/ai-helps-crack-a-nist-recommended-post-quantum-encryption-algorithm/	AI Helps Crack NIST-Recommended Post-Quantum Encryption Algorithm	The CRYSTALS-Kyber public-key encryption and key encapsulation mechanism recommended by NIST in July 2022 for post-quantum cryptography has been broken. Researchers from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, used recursive training AI combined with side channel attacks.  A side-channel attack exploits measurable information obtained from a device running the target implementation via channels such as timing or power consumption. The revolutionary aspect of the research (PDF) was to apply deep learning analysis to side-channel differential analysis.  “Deep learning-based side-channel attacks,” say the researchers, “can overcome conventional countermeasures such as masking, shuffling, random delays insertion, constant-weight encoding, code polymorphism, and randomized clock.”   The NIST-recommended encryption algorithms are the result of a NIST competition designed to provide encryption able to withstand quantum-computer attacks. Shor’s quantum algorithm will be able to defeat current classical encryption in polynomial time when quantum computers become a reality. This is expected by some to be within the next five to ten years – and has been called the cryptopocalypse.  The NIST approach to solving this issue is to develop more complex mathematical problems that are resistant to (although not necessarily proof against) quantum decryption. Such algorithms are described as quantum safe rather than quantum secure. Safe means it is safe until it is cracked; secure means it cannot be cracked by mathematical means. Basically, any problem based on mathematics could eventually be solved by mathematics.  The importance of the Swedish research is that quantum computers are not the only threat to encryption. Rapidly improving artificial intelligence may be a significant and more imminent threat to both classical and post-quantum encryption algorithms.  “[Our] approach is not specific for CRYSTALS-Kyber and can potentially be applied to other LWE/LWR PKE/KEM schemes. The recursive learning technique might have significance beyond side-channel attacks context,” say the researchers.  Skip Sanzeri, co-founder and COO at QuSecure, has already raised alarm at AI-assisted decryption. “New approaches are being developed promising the same post-quantum cybersecurity threats as a cryptographically relevant quantum computer, only much sooner,” he told SecurityWeek.  Steve Weston, co-founder and CTO at Incrypteon, has two concerns. “Firstly, it’s around the very conscious decision that NIST made to accept semantic secrecy as the bar we should aim for, rather than perfect secrecy – meaning that it’s based on complexity of a problem to be solved; that is, it will take a lot of compute effort and / or time to solve. Why as an Industry are we not aiming for perfect secrecy?”   Semantic secrecy is analogous to ‘safe’ encryption; perfect secrecy is analogous to ‘secure’ encryption. Perfect secrecy (secure encryption) can be obtained through the one-time pad. Qrypt has a one-time pad solution based on the simultaneous generation of quantum random numbers at both source and destination.  Incrypteon’s approach is to use Shannon’s equivocation point (in a patented technique known as perpetual equivocation) to minimize the key length for a one-time pad. Both approaches will be secure against AI-based decryption.  “Secondly,” continued Weston, “we only seem to be focused on securing against quantum attacks, not AI attacks. This is a real danger, if an AI operating on a single computer can break semantic post-quantum encryption.”  Weston has a further concern, which he calls ‘moot, but important’. “Why is it any innovation that comes out of trying to solve this problem (that is, creating an AI and quantum-resistant encryption with perfect secrecy characteristics) must then be ‘given away’ to NIST to be part of the process; requiring relinquishing of all IP rights for no reward or benefit?”  This approach, he suggests, will stifle innovation. “Why in 2023, is there no hybrid approach to industry standardization and IP ownership?”

His unit has been fighting through the city block by block. It feels as if enemies could be lying in silent wait behind every corner, ready to rain fire upon their marks the moment they have a shot.  Through his gunsight, the soldier scans the windows of a nearby building. He notices fresh laundry hanging from the balconies. Word comes in over the radio that his team is about to move across an open patch of ground below. As they head out, a red bounding box appears in the top left corner of the gunsight. The device’s computer vision system has flagged a potential target—a silhouetted figure in a window is drawing up, it seems, to take a shot.  The soldier doesn’t have a clear view, but in his experience the system has a superhuman capacity to pick up the faintest tell of an enemy. So he sets his crosshair upon the box and prepares to squeeze the trigger.   In different war, also possibly just over the horizon, a commander stands before a bank of monitors. An alert appears from a chatbot. It brings news that satellites have picked up a truck entering a certain city block that has been designated as a possible staging area for enemy rocket launches. The chatbot has already advised an artillery unit, which it calculates as having the highest estimated “kill probability,” to take aim at the truck and stand by.    According to the chatbot, none of the nearby buildings is a civilian structure, though it notes that the determination has yet to be corroborated manually. A drone, which had been dispatched by the system for a closer look, arrives on scene. Its video shows the truck backing into a narrow passage between two compounds. The opportunity to take the shot is rapidly coming to a close.   For the commander, everything now falls silent. The chaos, the uncertainty, the cacophony—all reduced to the sound of a ticking clock and the sight of a single glowing button:   “APPROVE FIRE ORDER.”   To pull the trigger—or, as the case may be, not to pull it. To hit the button, or to hold off. Legally—and ethically—the role of the soldier’s decision in matters of life and death is preeminent and indispensable. Fundamentally, it is these decisions that define the human act of war.  Related Story assisted suicide machine The messy morality of letting AI make life-and-death decisions Automation can help us make hard choices, but it can’t do it alone.  It should be of little surprise, then, that states and civil society have taken up the question of intelligent autonomous weapons—weapons that can select and fire upon targets without any human input—as a matter of serious concern. In May, after close to a decade of discussions, parties to the UN’s Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons agreed, among other recommendations, that militaries using them probably need to “limit the duration, geographical scope, and scale of the operation” to comply with the laws of war. The line was nonbinding, but it was at least an acknowledgment that a human has to play a part—somewhere, sometime—in the immediate process leading up to a killing.  But intelligent autonomous weapons that fully displace human decision-making have (likely) yet to see real-world use. Even the “autonomous” drones and ships fielded by the US and other powers are used under close human supervision. Meanwhile, intelligent systems that merely guide the hand that pulls the trigger have been gaining purchase in the warmaker’s tool kit. And they’ve quietly become sophisticated enough to raise novel questions—ones that are trickier to answer than the well-­covered wrangles over killer robots and, with each passing day, more urgent: What does it mean when a decision is only part human and part machine? And when, if ever, is it ethical for that decision to be a decision to kill?  For a long time, the idea of supporting a human decision by computerized means wasn’t such a controversial prospect. Retired Air Force lieutenant general Jack Shanahan says the radar on the F4 Phantom fighter jet he flew in the 1980s was a decision aid of sorts. It alerted him to the presence of other aircraft, he told me, so that he could figure out what to do about them. But to say that the crew and the radar were coequal accomplices would be a stretch.   That has all begun to change. “What we’re seeing now, at least in the way that I see this, is a transition to a world [in] which you need to have humans and machines … operating in some sort of team,” says Shanahan.  The rise of machine learning, in particular, has set off a paradigm shift in how militaries use computers to help shape the crucial decisions of warfare—up to, and including, the ultimate decision. Shanahan was the first director of Project Maven, a Pentagon program that developed target recognition algorithms for video footage from drones. The project, which kicked off a new era of American military AI, was launched in 2017 after a study concluded that “deep learning algorithms can perform at near-­human levels.” (It also sparked controversy—in 2018, more than 3,000 Google employees signed a letter of protest against the company’s involvement in the project.)  With machine-learning-based decision tools, “you have more apparent competency, more breadth” than earlier tools afforded, says Matt Turek, deputy director of the Information Innovation Office at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. “And perhaps a tendency, as a result, to turn over more decision-making to them.”     A soldier on the lookout for enemy snipers might, for example, do so through the Assault Rifle Combat Application System, a gunsight sold by the Israeli defense firm Elbit Systems. According to a company spec sheet, the “AI-powered” device is capable of “human target detection” at a range of more than 600 yards, and human target “identification” (presumably, discerning whether a person is someone who could be shot) at about the length of a football field. Anna Ahronheim-Cohen, a spokesperson for the company, told MIT Technology Review, “The system has already been tested in real-time scenarios by fighting infantry soldiers.”    YOSHI SODEOKA Another gunsight, built by the company Smartshooter, is advertised as having similar capabilities. According to the company’s website, it can also be packaged into a remote-controlled machine gun like the one that Israeli agents used to assassinate the Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2021.   Decision support tools that sit at a greater remove from the battlefield can be just as decisive. The Pentagon appears to have used AI in the sequence of intelligence analyses and decisions leading up to a potential strike, a process known as a kill chain—though it has been cagey on the details. In response to questions from MIT Technology Review, Laura McAndrews, an Air Force spokesperson, wrote that the service “is utilizing a human-­machine teaming approach.”  The range of judgment calls that go into military decision-making is vast. And it doesn’t always take artificial super-intelligence to dispense with them by automated means.  Other countries are more openly experimenting with such automation. Shortly after the Israel-Palestine conflict in 2021, the Israel Defense Forces said it had used what it described as AI tools to alert troops of imminent attacks and to propose targets for operations.  The Ukrainian army uses a program, GIS Arta, that pairs each known Russian target on the battlefield with the artillery unit that is, according to the algorithm, best placed to shoot at it. A report by The Times, a British newspaper, likened it to Uber’s algorithm for pairing drivers and riders, noting that it significantly reduces the time between the detection of a target and the moment that target finds itself under a barrage of firepower. Before the Ukrainians had GIS Arta, that process took 20 minutes. Now it reportedly takes one.  Russia claims to have its own command-and-control system with what it calls artificial intelligence, but it has shared few technical details. Gregory Allen, the director of the Wadhwani Center for AI and Advanced Technologies and one of the architects of the Pentagon’s current AI policies, told me it’s important to take some of these claims with a pinch of salt. He says some of Russia’s supposed military AI is “stuff that everyone has been doing for decades,” and he calls GIS Arta “just traditional software.”  The range of judgment calls that go into military decision-making, however, is vast. And it doesn’t always take artificial super-­intelligence to dispense with them by automated means. There are tools for predicting enemy troop movements, tools for figuring out how to take out a given target, and tools to estimate how much collateral harm is likely to befall any nearby civilians.   None of these contrivances could be called a killer robot. But the technology is not without its perils. Like any complex computer, an AI-based tool might glitch in unusual and unpredictable ways; it’s not clear that the human involved will always be able to know when the answers on the screen are right or wrong. In their relentless efficiency, these tools may also not leave enough time and space for humans to determine if what they’re doing is legal. In some areas, they could perform at such superhuman levels that something ineffable about the act of war could be lost entirely.  Eventually militaries plan to use machine intelligence to stitch many of these individual instruments into a single automated network that links every weapon, commander, and soldier to every other. Not a kill chain, but—as the Pentagon has begun to call it—a kill web.  In these webs, it’s not clear whether the human’s decision is, in fact, very much of a decision at all. Rafael, an Israeli defense giant, has already sold one such product, Fire Weaver, to the IDF (it has also demonstrated it to the US Department of Defense and the German military). According to company materials, Fire Weaver finds enemy positions, notifies the unit that it calculates as being best placed to fire on them, and even sets a crosshair on the target directly in that unit’s weapon sights. The human’s role, according to one video of the software, is to choose between two buttons: “Approve” and “Abort.”  Let’s say that the silhouette in the window was not a soldier, but a child. Imagine that the truck was not delivering warheads to the enemy, but water pails to a home.   Of the DoD’s five “ethical principles for artificial intelligence,” which are phrased as qualities, the one that’s always listed first is “Responsible.” In practice, this means that when things go wrong, someone—a human, not a machine—has got to hold the bag.    Of course, the principle of responsibility long predates the onset of artificially intelligent machines. All the laws and mores of war would be meaningless without the fundamental common understanding that every deliberate act in the fight is always on someone. But with the prospect of computers taking on all manner of sophisticated new roles, the age-old precept has newfound resonance.   Of the Department of Defense’s 5 “ethical principles for artificial intelligence,” which are phrased as qualities, the one that’s always listed first is “Responsible.” “Now for me, and for most people I ever knew in uniform, this was core to who we were as commanders: that somebody ultimately will be held responsible,” says Shanahan, who after Maven became the inaugural director of the Pentagon’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center and oversaw the development of the AI ethical principles.   This is why a human hand must squeeze the trigger, why a human hand must click “Approve.” If a computer sets its sights upon the wrong target, and the soldier squeezes the trigger anyway, that’s on the soldier. “If a human does something that leads to an accident with the machine—say, dropping a weapon where it shouldn’t have—that’s still a human’s decision that was made,” Shanahan says.  But accidents happen. And this is where things get tricky. Modern militaries have spent hundreds of years figuring out how to differentiate the unavoidable, blameless tragedies of warfare from acts of malign intent, misdirected fury, or gross negligence. Even now, this remains a difficult task. Outsourcing a part of human agency and judgment to algorithms built, in many cases, around the mathematical principle of optimization will challenge all this law and doctrine in a fundamentally new way, says Courtney Bowman, global director of privacy and civil liberties engineering at Palantir, a US-headquartered firm that builds data management software for militaries, governments, and large companies.   “It’s a rupture. It’s disruptive,” Bowman says. “It requires a new ethical construct to be able to make sound decisions.”  This year, in a move that was inevitable in the age of ChatGPT, Palantir announced that it is developing software called the Artificial Intelligence Platform, which allows for the integration of large language models into the company’s military products. In a demo of AIP posted to YouTube this spring, the platform alerts the user to a potentially threatening enemy movement. It then suggests that a drone be sent for a closer look, proposes three possible plans to intercept the offending force, and maps out an optimal route for the selected attack team to reach them.  And yet even with a machine capable of such apparent cleverness, militaries won’t want the user to blindly trust its every suggestion. If the human presses only one button in a kill chain, it probably should not be the “I believe” button, as a concerned but anonymous Army operative once put it in a DoD war game in 2019.   In a program called Urban Reconnaissance through Supervised Autonomy (URSA), DARPA built a system that enabled robots and drones to act as forward observers for platoons in urban operations. After input from the project’s advisory group on ethical and legal issues, it was decided that the software would only ever designate people as “persons of interest.” Even though the purpose of the technology was to help root out ambushes, it would never go so far as to label anyone as a “threat.”  This, it was hoped, would stop a soldier from jumping to the wrong conclusion. It also had a legal rationale, according to Brian Williams, an adjunct research staff member at the Institute for Defense Analyses who led the advisory group. No court had positively asserted that a machine could legally designate a person a threat, he says. (Then again, he adds, no court had specifically found that it would be illegal, either, and he acknowledges that not all military operators would necessarily share his group’s cautious reading of the law.) According to Williams, DARPA initially wanted URSA to be able to autonomously discern a person’s intent; this feature too was scrapped at the group’s urging.  Bowman says Palantir’s approach is to work “engineered inefficiencies” into “points in the decision-­making process where you actually do want to slow things down.” For example, a computer’s output that points to an enemy troop movement, he says, might require a user to seek out a second corroborating source of intelligence before proceeding with an action (in the video, the Artificial Intelligence Platform does not appear to do this).    “If people of interest are identified on a screen as red dots, that’s going to have a different subconscious implication than if people of interest are identified on a screen as little happy faces.”  Rebecca Crootof, law professor at the University of Richmond In the case of AIP, Bowman says the idea is to present the information in such a way “that the viewer understands, the analyst understands, this is only a suggestion.” In practice, protecting human judgment from the sway of a beguilingly smart machine could come down to small details of graphic design. “If people of interest are identified on a screen as red dots, that’s going to have a different subconscious implication than if people of interest are identified on a screen as little happy faces,” says Rebecca Crootof, a law professor at the University of Richmond, who has written extensively about the challenges of accountability in human-in-the-loop autonomous weapons.  In some settings, however, soldiers might only want an “I believe” button. Originally, DARPA envisioned URSA as a wrist-worn device for soldiers on the front lines. “In the very first working group meeting, we said that’s not advisable,” Williams told me. The kind of engineered inefficiency necessary for responsible use just wouldn’t be practicable for users who have bullets whizzing by their ears. Instead, they built a computer system that sits with a dedicated operator, far behind the action.   But some decision support systems are definitely designed for the kind of split-second decision-­making that happens right in the thick of it. The US Army has said that it has managed, in live tests, to shorten its own 20-minute targeting cycle to 20 seconds. Nor does the market seem to have embraced the spirit of restraint. In demo videos posted online, the bounding boxes for the computerized gunsights of both Elbit and Smartshooter are blood red.  Other times, the computer will be right and the human will be wrong.   If the soldier on the rooftop had second-guessed the gunsight, and it turned out that the silhouette was in fact an enemy sniper, his teammates could have paid a heavy price for his split second of hesitation.  This is a different source of trouble, much less discussed but no less likely in real-world combat. And it puts the human in something of a pickle. Soldiers will be told to treat their digital assistants with enough mistrust to safeguard the sanctity of their judgment. But with machines that are often right, this same reluctance to defer to the computer can itself become a point of avertable failure.   Aviation history has no shortage of cases where a human pilot’s refusal to heed the machine led to catastrophe. These (usually perished) souls have not been looked upon kindly by investigators seeking to explain the tragedy. Carol J. Smith, a senior research scientist at Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute who helped craft responsible AI guidelines for the DoD’s Defense Innovation Unit, doesn’t see an issue: “If the person in that moment feels that the decision is wrong, they’re making it their call, and they’re going to have to face the consequences.”   For others, this is a wicked ethical conundrum. The scholar M.C. Elish has suggested that a human who is placed in this kind of impossible loop could end up serving as what she calls a “moral crumple zone.” In the event of an accident—regardless of whether the human was wrong, the computer was wrong, or they were wrong together—the person who made the “decision” will absorb the blame and protect everyone else along the chain of command from the full impact of accountability.   In an essay, Smith wrote that the “lowest-paid person” should not be “saddled with this responsibility,” and neither should “the highest-paid person.” Instead, she told me, the responsibility should be spread among everyone involved, and the introduction of AI should not change anything about that responsibility.   In practice, this is harder than it sounds. Crootof points out that even today, “there’s not a whole lot of responsibility for accidents in war.” As AI tools become larger and more complex, and as kill chains become shorter and more web-like, finding the right people to blame is going to become an even more labyrinthine task.   Those who write these tools, and the companies they work for, aren’t likely to take the fall. Building AI software is a lengthy, iterative process, often drawing from open-source code, which stands at a distant remove from the actual material facts of metal piercing flesh. And barring any significant changes to US law, defense contractors are generally protected from liability anyway, says Crootof.  Related Story silhouette of a woman made with burning paper Responsible AI has a burnout problem Companies say they want ethical AI. But those working in the field say that ambition comes at their expense.  Any bid for accountability at the upper rungs of command, meanwhile, would likely find itself stymied by the heavy veil of government classification that tends to cloak most AI decision support tools and the manner in which they are used. The US Air Force has not been forthcoming about whether its AI has even seen real-world use. Shanahan says Maven’s AI models were deployed for intelligence analysis soon after the project launched, and in 2021 the secretary of the Air Force said that “AI algorithms” had recently been applied “for the first time to a live operational kill chain,” with an Air Force spokesperson at the time adding that these tools were available in intelligence centers across the globe “whenever needed.” But Laura McAndrews, the Air Force spokesperson, saidthat in fact these algorithms “were not applied in a live, operational kill chain” and declined to detail any other algorithms that may, or may not, have been used since.   The real story might remain shrouded for years. In 2018, the Pentagon issued a determination that exempts Project Maven from Freedom of Information requests. Last year, it handed the entire program to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency,which is responsible for processing ​America’s vast intake of secret aerial surveillance. Responding to questions about whether the algorithms are used in kill chains, Robbin Brooks, an NGA spokesperson, told MIT Technology Review, “We can’t speak to specifics of how and where Maven is used.”  In one sense, what’s new here is also old. We routinely place our safety—indeed, our entire existence as a species—in the hands of other people. Those decision-­makers defer, in turn, to machines that they do not entirely comprehend.   In an exquisite essay on automation published in 2018, at a time when operational AI-enabled decision support was still a rarity, former Navy secretary Richard Danzig pointed out that if a president “decides” to order a nuclear strike, it will not be because anyone has looked out the window of the Oval Office and seen enemy missiles raining down on DC but, rather, because those missiles have been detected, tracked, and identified—one hopes correctly—by algorithms in the air defense network.   As in the case of a commander who calls in an artillery strike on the advice of a chatbot, or a rifleman who pulls the trigger at the mere sight of a red bounding box, “the most that can be said is that ‘a human being is involved,’” Danzig wrote.   “This is a common situation in the modern age,” he wrote. “Human decisionmakers are riders traveling across obscured terrain with little or no ability to assess the powerful beasts that carry and guide them.”   There can be an alarming streak of defeatism among the people responsible for making sure that these beasts don’t end up eating us. During a number of conversations I had while reporting this story, my interlocutor would land on a sobering note of acquiescence to the perpetual inevitability of death and destruction that, while tragic, cannot be pinned on any single human. War is messy, technologies fail in unpredictable ways, and that’s just that.    YOSHI SODEOKA “In warfighting,” says Bowman of Palantir, “[in] the application of any technology, let alone AI, there is some degree of harm that you’re trying to—that you have to accept, and the game is risk reduction.”   It is possible, though not yet demonstrated, that bringing artificial intelligence to battle may mean fewer civilian casualties, as advocates often claim. But there could be a hidden cost to irrevocably conjoining human judgment and mathematical reasoning in those ultimate moments of war—a cost that extends beyond a simple, utilitarian bottom line. Maybe something just cannot be right, should not be right, about choosing the time and manner in which a person dies the way you hail a ride from Uber.   To a machine, this might be suboptimal logic. But for certain humans, that’s the point. “One of the aspects of judgment, as a human capacity, is that it’s done in an open world,” says Lucy Suchman, a professor emerita of anthropology at Lancaster University, who has been writing about the quandaries of human-machine interaction for four decades.   The parameters of life-and-death decisions—knowing the meaning of the fresh laundry hanging from a window while also wanting your teammates not to die—are “irreducibly qualitative,” she says. The chaos and the noise and the uncertainty, the weight of what is right and what is wrong in the midst of all that fury—not a whit of this can be defined in algorithmic terms. In matters of life and death, there is no computationally perfect outcome. “And that’s where the moral responsibility comes from,” she says. “You’re making a judgment.”   The gunsight never pulls the trigger. The chatbot never pushes the button. But each time a machine takes on a new role that reduces the irreducible, we may be stepping a little closer to the moment when the act of killing is altogether more machine than human, when ethics becomes a formula and responsibility becomes little more than an abstraction. If we agree that we don’t want to let the machines take us all the way there, sooner or later we will have to ask ourselves: Where is the line?

His unit has been fighting through the city block by block. It feels as if enemies could be lying in silent wait behind every corner, ready to rain fire upon their marks the moment they have a shot.  Through his gunsight, the soldier scans the windows of a nearby building. He notices fresh laundry hanging from the balconies. Word comes in over the radio that his team is about to move across an open patch of ground below. As they head out, a red bounding box appears in the top left corner of the gunsight. The device’s computer vision system has flagged a potential target—a silhouetted figure in a window is drawing up, it seems, to take a shot.  The soldier doesn’t have a clear view, but in his experience the system has a superhuman capacity to pick up the faintest tell of an enemy. So he sets his crosshair upon the box and prepares to squeeze the trigger.   In different war, also possibly just over the horizon, a commander stands before a bank of monitors. An alert appears from a chatbot. It brings news that satellites have picked up a truck entering a certain city block that has been designated as a possible staging area for enemy rocket launches. The chatbot has already advised an artillery unit, which it calculates as having the highest estimated “kill probability,” to take aim at the truck and stand by.    According to the chatbot, none of the nearby buildings is a civilian structure, though it notes that the determination has yet to be corroborated manually. A drone, which had been dispatched by the system for a closer look, arrives on scene. Its video shows the truck backing into a narrow passage between two compounds. The opportunity to take the shot is rapidly coming to a close.   For the commander, everything now falls silent. The chaos, the uncertainty, the cacophony—all reduced to the sound of a ticking clock and the sight of a single glowing button:   “APPROVE FIRE ORDER.”   To pull the trigger—or, as the case may be, not to pull it. To hit the button, or to hold off. Legally—and ethically—the role of the soldier’s decision in matters of life and death is preeminent and indispensable. Fundamentally, it is these decisions that define the human act of war.  Related Story assisted suicide machine The messy morality of letting AI make life-and-death decisions Automation can help us make hard choices, but it can’t do it alone.  It should be of little surprise, then, that states and civil society have taken up the question of intelligent autonomous weapons—weapons that can select and fire upon targets without any human input—as a matter of serious concern. In May, after close to a decade of discussions, parties to the UN’s Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons agreed, among other recommendations, that militaries using them probably need to “limit the duration, geographical scope, and scale of the operation” to comply with the laws of war. The line was nonbinding, but it was at least an acknowledgment that a human has to play a part—somewhere, sometime—in the immediate process leading up to a killing.  But intelligent autonomous weapons that fully displace human decision-making have (likely) yet to see real-world use. Even the “autonomous” drones and ships fielded by the US and other powers are used under close human supervision. Meanwhile, intelligent systems that merely guide the hand that pulls the trigger have been gaining purchase in the warmaker’s tool kit. And they’ve quietly become sophisticated enough to raise novel questions—ones that are trickier to answer than the well-­covered wrangles over killer robots and, with each passing day, more urgent: What does it mean when a decision is only part human and part machine? And when, if ever, is it ethical for that decision to be a decision to kill?  For a long time, the idea of supporting a human decision by computerized means wasn’t such a controversial prospect. Retired Air Force lieutenant general Jack Shanahan says the radar on the F4 Phantom fighter jet he flew in the 1980s was a decision aid of sorts. It alerted him to the presence of other aircraft, he told me, so that he could figure out what to do about them. But to say that the crew and the radar were coequal accomplices would be a stretch.   That has all begun to change. “What we’re seeing now, at least in the way that I see this, is a transition to a world [in] which you need to have humans and machines … operating in some sort of team,” says Shanahan.  The rise of machine learning, in particular, has set off a paradigm shift in how militaries use computers to help shape the crucial decisions of warfare—up to, and including, the ultimate decision. Shanahan was the first director of Project Maven, a Pentagon program that developed target recognition algorithms for video footage from drones. The project, which kicked off a new era of American military AI, was launched in 2017 after a study concluded that “deep learning algorithms can perform at near-­human levels.” (It also sparked controversy—in 2018, more than 3,000 Google employees signed a letter of protest against the company’s involvement in the project.)

Bowman says Palantir’s approach is to work “engineered inefficiencies” into “points in the decision-­making process where you actually do want to slow things down.” For example, a computer’s output that points to an enemy troop movement, he says, might require a user to seek out a second corroborating source of intelligence before proceeding with an action (in the video, the Artificial Intelligence Platform does not appear to do this).    “If people of interest are identified on a screen as red dots, that’s going to have a different subconscious implication than if people of interest are identified on a screen as little happy faces.”  Rebecca Crootof, law professor at the University of Richmond In the case of AIP, Bowman says the idea is to present the information in such a way “that the viewer understands, the analyst understands, this is only a suggestion.” In practice, protecting human judgment from the sway of a beguilingly smart machine could come down to small details of graphic design. “If people of interest are identified on a screen as red dots, that’s going to have a different subconscious implication than if people of interest are identified on a screen as little happy faces,” says Rebecca Crootof, a law professor at the University of Richmond, who has written extensively about the challenges of accountability in human-in-the-loop autonomous weapons.  In some settings, however, soldiers might only want an “I believe” button. Originally, DARPA envisioned URSA as a wrist-worn device for soldiers on the front lines. “In the very first working group meeting, we said that’s not advisable,” Williams told me. The kind of engineered inefficiency necessary for responsible use just wouldn’t be practicable for users who have bullets whizzing by their ears. Instead, they built a computer system that sits with a dedicated operator, far behind the action.   But some decision support systems are definitely designed for the kind of split-second decision-­making that happens right in the thick of it. The US Army has said that it has managed, in live tests, to shorten its own 20-minute targeting cycle to 20 seconds. Nor does the market seem to have embraced the spirit of restraint. In demo videos posted online, the bounding boxes for the computerized gunsights of both Elbit and Smartshooter are blood red.  Other times, the computer will be right and the human will be wrong.   If the soldier on the rooftop had second-guessed the gunsight, and it turned out that the silhouette was in fact an enemy sniper, his teammates could have paid a heavy price for his split second of hesitation.  This is a different source of trouble, much less discussed but no less likely in real-world combat. And it puts the human in something of a pickle. Soldiers will be told to treat their digital assistants with enough mistrust to safeguard the sanctity of their judgment. But with machines that are often right, this same reluctance to defer to the computer can itself become a point of avertable failure.   Aviation history has no shortage of cases where a human pilot’s refusal to heed the machine led to catastrophe. These (usually perished) souls have not been looked upon kindly by investigators seeking to explain the tragedy. Carol J. Smith, a senior research scientist at Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute who helped craft responsible AI guidelines for the DoD’s Defense Innovation Unit, doesn’t see an issue: “If the person in that moment feels that the decision is wrong, they’re making it their call, and they’re going to have to face the consequences.”   For others, this is a wicked ethical conundrum. The scholar M.C. Elish has suggested that a human who is placed in this kind of impossible loop could end up serving as what she calls a “moral crumple zone.” In the event of an accident—regardless of whether the human was wrong, the computer was wrong, or they were wrong together—the person who made the “decision” will absorb the blame and protect everyone else along the chain of command from the full impact of accountability.   In an essay, Smith wrote that the “lowest-paid person” should not be “saddled with this responsibility,” and neither should “the highest-paid person.” Instead, she told me, the responsibility should be spread among everyone involved, and the introduction of AI should not change anything about that responsibility.   In practice, this is harder than it sounds. Crootof points out that even today, “there’s not a whole lot of responsibility for accidents in war.” As AI tools become larger and more complex, and as kill chains become shorter and more web-like, finding the right people to blame is going to become an even more labyrinthine task.   Those who write these tools, and the companies they work for, aren’t likely to take the fall. Building AI software is a lengthy, iterative process, often drawing from open-source code, which stands at a distant remove from the actual material facts of metal piercing flesh. And barring any significant changes to US law, defense contractors are generally protected from liability anyway, says Crootof.  Related Story silhouette of a woman made with burning paper Responsible AI has a burnout problem Companies say they want ethical AI. But those working in the field say that ambition comes at their expense.  Any bid for accountability at the upper rungs of command, meanwhile, would likely find itself stymied by the heavy veil of government classification that tends to cloak most AI decision support tools and the manner in which they are used. The US Air Force has not been forthcoming about whether its AI has even seen real-world use. Shanahan says Maven’s AI models were deployed for intelligence analysis soon after the project launched, and in 2021 the secretary of the Air Force said that “AI algorithms” had recently been applied “for the first time to a live operational kill chain,” with an Air Force spokesperson at the time adding that these tools were available in intelligence centers across the globe “whenever needed.” But Laura McAndrews, the Air Force spokesperson, saidthat in fact these algorithms “were not applied in a live, operational kill chain” and declined to detail any other algorithms that may, or may not, have been used since.   The real story might remain shrouded for years. In 2018, the Pentagon issued a determination that exempts Project Maven from Freedom of Information requests. Last year, it handed the entire program to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency,which is responsible for processing ​America’s vast intake of secret aerial surveillance. Responding to questions about whether the algorithms are used in kill chains, Robbin Brooks, an NGA spokesperson, told MIT Technology Review, “We can’t speak to specifics of how and where Maven is used.”  In one sense, what’s new here is also old. We routinely place our safety—indeed, our entire existence as a species—in the hands of other people. Those decision-­makers defer, in turn, to machines that they do not entirely comprehend.   In an exquisite essay on automation published in 2018, at a time when operational AI-enabled decision support was still a rarity, former Navy secretary Richard Danzig pointed out that if a president “decides” to order a nuclear strike, it will not be because anyone has looked out the window of the Oval Office and seen enemy missiles raining down on DC but, rather, because those missiles have been detected, tracked, and identified—one hopes correctly—by algorithms in the air defense network.   As in the case of a commander who calls in an artillery strike on the advice of a chatbot, or a rifleman who pulls the trigger at the mere sight of a red bounding box, “the most that can be said is that ‘a human being is involved,’” Danzig wrote.   “This is a common situation in the modern age,” he wrote. “Human decisionmakers are riders traveling across obscured terrain with little or no ability to assess the powerful beasts that carry and guide them.”   There can be an alarming streak of defeatism among the people responsible for making sure that these beasts don’t end up eating us. During a number of conversations I had while reporting this story, my interlocutor would land on a sobering note of acquiescence to the perpetual inevitability of death and destruction that, while tragic, cannot be pinned on any single human. War is messy, technologies fail in unpredictable ways, and that’s just that.    YOSHI SODEOKA “In warfighting,” says Bowman of Palantir, “[in] the application of any technology, let alone AI, there is some degree of harm that you’re trying to—that you have to accept, and the game is risk reduction.”   It is possible, though not yet demonstrated, that bringing artificial intelligence to battle may mean fewer civilian casualties, as advocates often claim. But there could be a hidden cost to irrevocably conjoining human judgment and mathematical reasoning in those ultimate moments of war—a cost that extends beyond a simple, utilitarian bottom line. Maybe something just cannot be right, should not be right, about choosing the time and manner in which a person dies the way you hail a ride from Uber.   To a machine, this might be suboptimal logic. But for certain humans, that’s the point. “One of the aspects of judgment, as a human capacity, is that it’s done in an open world,” says Lucy Suchman, a professor emerita of anthropology at Lancaster University, who has been writing about the quandaries of human-machine interaction for four decades.   The parameters of life-and-death decisions—knowing the meaning of the fresh laundry hanging from a window while also wanting your teammates not to die—are “irreducibly qualitative,” she says. The chaos and the noise and the uncertainty, the weight of what is right and what is wrong in the midst of all that fury—not a whit of this can be defined in algorithmic terms. In matters of life and death, there is no computationally perfect outcome. “And that’s where the moral responsibility comes from,” she says. “You’re making a judgment.”   The gunsight never pulls the trigger. The chatbot never pushes the button. But each time a machine takes on a new role that reduces the irreducible, we may be stepping a little closer to the moment when the act of killing is altogether more machine than human, when ethics becomes a formula and responsibility becomes little more than an abstraction. If we agree that we don’t want to let the machines take us all the way there, sooner or later we will have to ask ourselves: Where is the line? 	"When it comes to our health, especially in matters of life and death, the promise of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve outcomes is very intriguing. While there is still much to overcome to achieve AI-dependent health care, most notably data privacy concerns and fears of mismanaged care due to machine error and lack of human oversight, there is sufficient potential that governments, tech companies, and healthcare providers are willing to invest and test out AI-powered tools and solutions. Here are five of the AI advances in healthcare that appear to have the most potential.  Adobe Stock Adobe Stock ADOBE STOCK 1.        AI-assisted robotic surgery  With an estimated value of $40 billion to healthcare, robots can analyze data from pre-op medical records to guide a surgeon's instrument during surgery, which can lead to a 21% reduction in a patient's hospital stay. Robot-assisted surgery is considered ""minimally invasive"" so patients won't need to heal from large incisions. Via artificial intelligence, robots can use data from past operations to inform new surgical techniques. The positive results are indeed promising. One study that involved 379 orthopedic patients found that AI-assisted robotic procedure resulted in five times fewer complications compared to surgeons operating alone. A robot was used on an eye surgery for the first time, and the most advanced surgical robot, the Da Vinci allows doctors to perform complex procedures with greater control than conventional approaches. Heart surgeons are assisted Heartlander, a miniature robot, that enters a small incision on the chest to perform mapping and therapy over the surface of the heart.   2.        Virtual nursing assistants  PROMOTED     From interacting with patients to directing patients to the most effective care setting, virtual nursing assistants could save the healthcare industry $20 billion annually. Since virtual nurses are available 24/7, they can answer questions, monitor patients and provide quick answers. Most applications of virtual nursing assistants today allow for more regular communication between patients and care providers between office visits to prevent hospital readmission or unnecessary hospital visits. Care Angel's virtual nurse assistant can even provide wellness checks through voice and AI.  3.        Aid clinical judgment or diagnosis  Admittedly, using AI to diagnose patients is undoubtedly in its infancy, but there have been some exciting use cases. A Stanford University study tested an AI algorithm to detect skin cancers against dermatologists, and it performed at the level of the humans. A Danish AI software company tested its deep-learning program by having a computer eavesdrop while human dispatchers took emergency calls. The algorithm analyzed what a person says, the tone of voice and background noise and detected cardiac arrests with a 93% success rate compared to 73% for humans. Baidu Research recently announced that the results of early tests on its deep learning algorithm indicate that it can outperform humans when identifying breast cancer metastasis. Prime minister Theresa May announced an AI revolution would help the National Health Service (NHS), the UK's healthcare system, predict those in an early stage of cancer to ultimately prevent thousands of cancer-related deaths by 2033. The algorithms will examine medical records, habits and genetic information pooled from health charities, the NHS and AI.  4.        Workflow and administrative tasks  Another way AI can impact healthcare is to automate administrative tasks. It is expected that this could result in $18 billion in savings for the healthcare industry as machines can help doctors, nurses and other providers save time on tasks. Technology such as voice-to-text transcriptions could help order tests, prescribe medications and write chart notes. One example of using AI to support admin tasks is a partnership between the Cleveland Clinic and IBM that uses IBM’s Watson to mine big data and help physicians provide a personalized and more efficient treatment experience. One way Watson supports physicians is being able to analyze thousands of medical papers using natural language processing to inform treatment plans.

Image analysis  Currently, image analysis is very time consuming for human providers, but an MIT-led research team developed a machine-learning algorithm that can analyze 3D scans up to 1,000 times faster than what is possible today. This near real-time assessment can provide critical input for surgeons who are operating. It is also hoped that AI can help to improve the next generation of radiology tools that don’t rely on tissue samples. Additionally, AI image analysis could support remote areas that don’t have easy access to healthcare providers and even make telemedicine more effective as patients can use their camera phones to send in pics of rashes, cuts or bruises to determine what care is necessary.  In the very complex world of healthcare, AI tools can support human providers to provide faster service, diagnose issues and analyze data to identify trends or genetic information that would predispose someone to a particular disease. When saving minutes can mean saving lives, AI and machine learning can be transformative not only for healthcare but for every single patient."

CRYSTALS-Kyber has been selected by the NIST as a publickey encryption and key encapsulation mechanism to be standardized. It is also included in the NSA’s suite of cryptographic algorithms recommended for national security systems. This makes it important to evaluate the resistance of CRYSTALS-Kyber’s implementations to sidechannel attacks. The unprotected and first-order masked software implementations have been already analysed. In this paper, we present deep learning-based message recovery attacks on the ω-order masked implementations of CRYSTALS-Kyber in ARM Cortex-M4 CPU for ω ≤ 5. The main contribution is a new neural network training method called recursive learning. In the attack on an ω-order masked implementation, we start training from an artificially constructed neural network Mω whose weights are partly copied from a model Mω−1 trained on the (ω − 1)-order masked implementation, and then extended to one more share. Such a method allows us to train neural networks that can recover a message bit with the probability above 99% from high-order masked implementations. 1 Introduction Public-key cryptographic schemes used today depend on the intractability of certain mathematical problems such as integer factorization, or the discrete logarithm. However, if large-scale quantum computers become a reality, it will be possible to solve these problems in polynomial time using Shor’s algorithm [33]. Therefore current public-key cryptographic schemes will no longer be secure. To address this issue, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched a process for standardization of post-quantum cryptographic primitives, NIST PQC, in 2016. Candidate primitives rely on problems that are believed to be difficult for quantum computers, such as lattices and decoding in a linear error correcting code. The PQC process is currently in its fourth round. One of the finalists, IND-CCA2 secure public key encryption (PKE) and key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) CRYSTALS-Kyber [3], is already selected to be standardized [23]. It is also included in the National Security Agency (NSA) suite of cryptographic algorithms recommended for national security systems [1]. This makes it important to assess the resistance of CRYSTALS-Kyber implementations to side-channel attacks. Side-channel attacks exploit information 2 Elena Dubrova, Kalle Ngo, and Joel Gärtner obtained from physically measurable, non-primary channels such as timing or power consumption of a device running the implementation. The first breakthrough in the area was differential side-channel analysis pioneered by Kocher et al. [20]. The second breakthrough was the introduction of deep learning-based side-channel analysis. Apart from improving the differential attacks’ effectiveness (e.g. four instead of 400 power traces are required to extract the secret key from a commercial USIM card [10]), the latter enabled attacks of true random number generators [26], physical unclonable functions [42], and non-differential message and secret key recovery attacks on NIST PQC candidates. Deep learningbased side-channel attacks can overcome conventional countermeasures such as masking [27], shuffling [28], random delays insertion [13], constant-weight encoding [22], code polymorphism [7], and randomized clock [11]. The third important contribution is the error injection method of Wang et al. [38] which converts a non-differential attack into a differential. It allows for breaking difficult targets such as a hardware implementation of CRYSTALS-Kyber [19]. Our contributions: The unprotected and first-order masked software implementations of CRYSTALS-Kyber have been already analysed [31,31,34,8,24,40] [36,37,38,41]. That contributed to strengthening the resistance of its subsequently released versions [9,18] and promoted stronger mitigation techniques against side-channel attacks, e.g. [4,35,17]. Side-channel attacks on the secondand third-order masked software implementations of Saber, which is similar to CRYSTALS-Kyber in many aspects, have also been presented [29,30]. In this paper, we demonstrate side-channel attacks on up to the fifth-order masked implementations of CRYSTALS-Kyber in ARM Cortex-M4 CPU. The first contribution of the paper is a new neural network training method which we call recursive learning. In the attack on an ω-order masked implementation, we start training from an artificially constructed neural network Mω whose weights are partly copied from a neural network Mω−1 trained on the (ω − 1)-order masked implementation, and then extended to include one more share. Such a method allows us to effortlessly train neural networks that can recover a message bit with the probability above 99%. For higher masking orders, the likelihood of finding such a model without recursive learning is very small. Another novel contribution is a message recovery method using cyclic rotations. In the procedure that is our attack point, the first bit of each message byte leak considerably stronger than the last one. We negacyclically rotate the message to shift its bits from “less leaky” positions to “more leaky” ones. This allow us to increase the success rate of message recovery. The messages are rotated by manipulating the corresponding ciphertexts. In CRYSTALS-Kyber, a successful message recovery implies the shared session key recovery, as the session key is derived from the message using hash functions. Furthermore, by recovering messages contained in a set of chosen ciphertexts constructed used known methods, e.g. [5,32], one can extract the long-term secret key of CRYSTALS-Kyber. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes previous work. Section 3 gives a background on CRYSTALS-Kyber and masking. Sec- 2. PREVIOUS WORK 3 tion 4 presents the equipment and target implementations. Sections 5 and 6 describe the profiling and attack stages, respectively. Section 7 summarizes the experimental results. Section 8 concludes the paper and discusses open problems. 2 Previous work This section describes previous side-channel attacks on protected implementations of CRYSTALS-Kyber and related schemes based on module lattices. In [31], a two-step message recovery attack on masked software implementations of LWE/LWR PKE/KEMs is described. At the first step, each share is recovered using templates created on traces with known masks. At the second step, the message is computed from the shares. In [27], a one-step message recovery method is introduced in which the message is recovered directly, without recovering the shares explicitly. This is done using a neural network which is trained at the profiling stage on traces containing both shares labelled by the value of the corresponding message bit. A great advantage of the one-step method is that it allows for the profiling on traces captured from the device under attack. This helps maximize the neural network prediction accuracy, since neither intra-device variability, nor device aging, degrade the models. In [27], the one-step method is applied to the first-order masked software implementation of Saber from [6] using poly_A2A() and POL2MSG() procedures as the attack points. In [29], it is extended to the second- and third-order masked software implementations of Saber from [21] using A2B_bitsliced_msg() procedure as the attack point. In [30] it is applied to the second-order masked software implementation of Saber from [21] using POL2MSG() as the attack point and the error-injection method [38] as the attack strategy. In both attacks, [29] and [30], neural networks trained at the profiling stage have no trouble recovering the value of a specific message bit from traces that contain all shares corresponding to this bit. However, our experiments show that difficulties begin to appear at higher masking orders. The one-step message recovery method [27] is utilized in the side-channel attacks on a first-order masked and shuffled software implementation of Saber presented in [28] and [5]. These attacks require 61,680 and 4,608 traces to extract the secret key by deep learning-based power analysis, respectively. The former attack is based on message Hamming weight extraction and bit flipping, while the later on shuffling index recovery and cyclic rotations. In [5], a successful secret key recovery attack on a first-order masked and shuffled software implementation of CRYSTALS-Kyber is also demonstrated. The implementation is built on the top of the first-order masked implementation from [15]. The attack uses masked_poly_tomsg() procedure as the attack point. In [37], the one-step method [27] is applied to the first-order masked implementation of CRYSTALS-Kyber, targeting the message encoding vulnerability found in [34]. In [8], side-channel attacks on two implementations of masked polynomial comparison are shown on the example of CRYSTALS-Kyber. 4 Elena Dubrova, Kalle Ngo, and Joel Gärtner CPAPKE.KeyGen() 1: seedA ← U({0, 1} 256) 2: A ← U(R k×k q ; seedA) 3: s ← Bη1 (R k×1 q ) 4: e ← Bη1 (R k×1 q ) 5: b = As + ep1 6: pk = (seedA, b), sk = s 7: return (pk, sk) CPAPKE.Dec(s, c = (u, v)) 1: y =  v · q/2 dv  − s  u · q/2 du  2: m′ = decode(y) 3: return m′ CPAPKE.Enc(pk = (seedA, b), m, r) 1: A ← U(R k×k q ; seedA) 2: s ′ ← Bη1 (R k×1 q ; r) 3: e ′ ← Bη2 (R k×1 q ; r) 4: e ′′ ← Bη2 (R 1×1 q ; r) 5: u =  (As′ + e ′ ) · 2 du /q 6: v =  (b · s ′ + e ′′ + encode(m)) · 2 dv /q 7: return c = (u, v) Fig. 1: Pseudocode of CCAPKE algorithms [5].

Apart from the one-step message recovery method, an error-correcting codebased chosen ciphertext construction approach is introduced in [27]. The secret key of Saber is recovered from messages extracted from these ciphertexts. In [27], an extended Hamming code with the code distance four is used. It can correct single-bit errors and detect one additional error in each secret key coefficient. More powerful codes with the code distance up to six for Saber and up to eight for CRYSTALS-Kyber are utilized in [5]. The secret key is recovered using k·l chosen ciphertexts, where k is the rank of the module and l is the length of the code. Another code-based chosen ciphertext construction method for CRYSTALS-Kyber is described in [32]. While the non-code-based secret key recovery method presented earlier in [31] uses less ciphertexts than the code-based methods [27,5,32], its drawback is the perfect message recovery requirement. 3 Background This section provides background information on CRYSTALS-Kyber [3] and masking countermeasure against side-channel attacks. 4. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 5 3.1 CRYSTALS-Kyber Fig. 1 and 2 show pseudocodes of CPAPKE and CCAKEM algorithms, respectively. We follow the notation of [5]. CPAPKE consists of key generation, CPAPKE. KeyGen(); encryption, CPAPKE.Enc(); and decryption, CPAPKE.Dec(), parts. CPAKEM contains key generation, CCAKEM.KeyGen(); encapsulation, CCAKEM. Encaps(); and decapsulation, CCAKEM.Decaps(), parts. The ring Rq in CPAPKE is the quotient ring Zq[X]/(X256 + 1), where Zq is the ring of integers modulo a positive integer q = 3329. Sampling v from a distribution χi over a set S is denoted by v ← χi(S) while v ← χi(S; r) denotes deterministic sampling from χi using seed r. The centered binomial distributions is denoted by Bηi and the uniform distribution is denoted by U. The security level of CRYSTALS-Kyber is defined by the rank k of the module. In this paper, we focus on k = 3, Kyber768. Other cases can be handled similarly. 3.2 Masking Masking is a well-known countermeasure against power/EM side-channel analysis [12]. A ω-order masking partitions any sensitive variable x into ω + 1 shares, x1, x2, . . . , xω+1, such that x = x1 ◦x2 ◦. . .◦xω+1, and performs es all operations separately on the shares. The operator “◦” depends on the type of masking, e.g. in arithmetic masking “◦” is equal to “+” and in Boolean masking “◦” is “⊕” . Since computations do not involve x directly, carrying out operations separately on the shares x1, x2, . . . , xω+1 should in theory prevent the leakage of side-channel information related to x. Instead, the shares x1, x2, . . . , xω+1 are linked to the leakage. Since the shares are randomized at each execution, they are not expected to contain any exploitable information about x. Typically, the randomization is performed by assigning random masks ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . , ϕω to ω shares and deriving the last share as x − (ϕ1 + ϕ2 + . . . + ϕω) for arithmetic masking or x ⊕ ϕ1 ⊕ ϕ2 ⊕ . . . ⊕ ϕω for Boolean masking. 4 Experimental setup In this section, we describe the equipment and target implementation. 4.1 Target implementation To the best of our knowledge, there are no publicly available higher-order masked implementations of CRYSTALS-Kyber1 . All experiments presented in this paper are performed on the C implementation of the first-order masked CRYSTALSKyber from [16] which we modified to extend masked_poly_frommsg() procedure to a higher-order masking. We extended the part of the code required for proving 1 The higher-order masked software implementation of CRYSTALS-Kyber presented in [9] is not publicly available. 6 Elena Dubrova, Kalle Ngo, and Joel Gärtner void masked_poly_frommsg(uint16 poly[2][256], uint8 msg[2][32]) uint16 c[2]; 1: for (i = 0; i < 32; i++) do 2: for (j = 0; j < 8; j++) do 3: mask = -((msg[0][i] » j) & 1); 4: poly[0][8*i+j] += (mask&((KYBER_Q+1)/2)); 5: end for 6: end for 7: for (i = 0; i < 32; i++) do 8: for (j = 0; j < 8; j++) do 9: mask = -((msg[1][i] » j) & 1); 10: poly[1][8*i+j] += (mask&((KYBER_Q+1)/2)); 11: end for 12: end for 13: ... Fig. 3: C code of masked_poly_frommsg() procedure of CRYSTALS-Kyber [16]. the attack’s concept only, not the complete CRYSTALS-Kyber package. We verified that power traces captured from the extended implementation for ω = 1 are similar to the traces of the original implementation [16]. We also verified that both implementations have a similar type of side-channel leakage by performing message recovery attacks on both. The resulting empirical mean message bit recovery probabilities were similar in both cases. Our attack point is the procedure masked_poly_frommsg() shown in Fig. 3. This procedure is called during the re-encryption step of decapsulation (line 3 of CCAKEM.Decaps() in Fig. 2). It performs the encoding of message shares from the Boolean domain into the polynomial domain (line 6 of CPAPKE.Enc() in Fig. 1). The red lines in Fig. 3 show the location of the vulnerability exploited in the attack. Such types of vulnerabilities are known as the determiner-leakage in previous works [2,34,31]. 4.2 Equipment For trace acquisition, we use a Chipwhisperer-lite board [25], a CW308 UFO board, and a CW308T-STM32F4 target board. CW308T-STM32F4 contains an ARM Cortex-M4 CPU with STM32F415-RGT6 device. The STM32F415- RGT6 is programmed to a C implementation of CRYSTALS-Kyber compiled with arm-none-eabi-gcc with the optimization level -O3 (recommended default). The target board is run and sampled at 24 MHz. 5 Profiling stage In this section, we describe our profiling strategy. The main difference from previous work is the new neural network training method which we call recursive 5.

The key idea is to use a neural network model Mω−1 , capable of breaking a (ω −1)-order masked implementation, as a stepping stone in the attack on the ω-order masked implementation. 5.1 Recursive learning method The attack presented in [27] has shown that neural networks are capable to: 8 Elena Dubrova, Kalle Ngo, and Joel Gärtner 1.

XOR values of the shares to obtain the ground truth label. The fact that neural networks are capable of learning the two-argument XOR operation was previously known [14, p. 166]. The results of [27] confirmed that the neural networks can combine the steps (1) and (2). In [29] it was further hypothesized that the complexity of learning the n-argument XOR grows linearly in the number of arguments n. Indeed, neural networks for message recovery from the second- and third-order masked software implementations of LWE/LWR PKE/KEMs can be trained directly [29,30], as in the attack of [27]. However, we found that, for higher masking orders, neural networks need help in order to learn. To help, we start training from an artificially constructed neural network, rather than a network with a standard random weight distribution. For an attack on an ω-order masked implementation, the starting network Mω is constructed by copying the weights of the input Batch Normalization layer of a model Mω−1 trained on the (ω − 1)-order masked implementation, and then extending the input Batch Normalization layer of Mω to include one more share, as shown in Fig. 4. In this way, we assist Mω in locating the traces’ segments corresponding to the processing of ω + 1 shares. The weights of all other layers of Mω are assigned at random. Recall that a Batch Normalization layer first standardizes the input values x of the layer using their respective mean, µ, and standard deviation, σ, xnorm = (x − µ)/σ, and then applies the scaling, γ (gamma) and offset, β (beta), parameters to the result, x ′ = (γ ∗ xnorm) + β. The parameters γ and β are learned by the model during the training process by adjusting the backpropagation algorithm to operate on the transformed inputs, and using the error to update the new scaling and offset parameters learned by the model. Thus, a higher value of γ indicates the higher importance of the corresponding input feature in the decision taken by the model. In our case, a neural network Mω−1 takes input values x = x1||x2|| . . . ||xω of ω concatenated share segments. Let γ j i , β j i , µ j i , and σ j i denote scaling parameters, offset parameters, mean and standard deviation of xi of the input Batch Normalization layer of Mj , for i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , j + 1} and j > 0. The input Batch Normalization layer of Mω, which takes input values x = x1||x2|| . . . ||xω+1, is constructed based on the weights of the input Batch Normalization layer of Mω−1 as follows: γ ω i = γ ω−1 i for all i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , ω}, γω ω+1 = γ ω−1 ω , β ω i = β ω−1 i for all i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , ω}, βω ω+1 = β ω−1 ω , µ ω i = µ ω−1 i for all i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , ω}, µω ω+1 = µ ω−1 ω , σ ω i = σ ω−1 i for all i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , ω}, σω ω+1 = σ ω−1 ω . In other words, we copy all parameters corresponding to ω shares and then extend by repeating the parameters of the last share one more time. Note that any other share of Mω−1 can be repeated instead of the last one. 5. PROFILING STAGE 9 Fig. 5: (top) Full power trace representing the execution of masked_poly_ frommsg() in the first-order masked implementation; (bottom) Weights of input Batch Normalization layer of a neural network trained on full traces with the 1st message bit values as labels. The peaks reveal the positions of two shares. The recursive learning method allows us to easily train good neural network models for message recovery attacks on high-order masked implementations. For masking orders ω > 4, the probability of finding such a model without recursive learning is very small. The recursive learning method might be viewed as related to transfer learning [39]. Different types of iterative re-training methods were used in side-channel attacks in the past, e.g. in [26,29]. Note, however, that we do not only transfer a model, but also extend it. We construct the initial weights of a larger neural network based on the weights of a smaller neural network. We could not find an analog of such a technique among known transfer learning methods. 5.2 Neural network type As in the previous deep learning-based message recovery attacks on masked software implementations of LWE/LWR PKE/KEMs [27,28], we train neural networks to recover messages directly, without explicitly extracting the random masks at each execution. Message bits values ‘0’ and ‘1’ are used as labels. Let R be the set of real numbers and let I := {x ∈ R | 0 ≤ x ≤ 1}. Let m = (m[0], m[1], . . . , m[255]) be a message of CRYSTALS-Kyber to be recovered, where m[i] is the ith message bit, and c = (u, v) be a ciphertext generated by CPAPKE.Enc() for m. 10 Elena Dubrova, Kalle Ngo, and Joel Gärtner To train a neural network Mi : R |T| → I which predicts m[i], each trace T in the training set T is labeled by m[i], where m is the message encrypted in c which is given as input to the device when T is captured. Mi maps each T into a score s = Mi(T) ∈ I representing the probability that m[i] = 1 in T. 5.3 Input data selection For the first-order masked implementation, we locate the segments of traces corresponding to the processing of shares by masked_poly_frommsg() by training neural networks on full traces and examining the weights of the input Batch Normalization layer after training, as shown in Fig. 5. The p-point intervals containing the peaks of γ parameters are extracted and concatenated to obtain the input data for to neural networks. In our experiments, we use p = 32. First we determine to location of shares for each message bit i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , 255} and estimate the distance between two adjacent bits. This is done by training neural networks M1 i and M1 i+1 for several bits i and i + 1 on full traces from the first-order masked implementation and measuring the distance between the peaks of γ parameters of their input Batch Normalization layers after training. In the same way we determine the distance between of shares x1 and x2, d, by measuring the distance between the peaks of γ parameters of the input Batch Normalization layers of M1 i after training. Once d for x1 and x2 is determined for the first-order masked implementation, an approximate location of each share xj in an ω-order masked implementation can be found by shifting the first share’s interval by (j − 1) ∗ d points, for j ∈ {2, . . . , ω + 1}. For example, if the p-point interval of trace corresponding to x1 share is [s : s+p], then the interval corresponding to xω+1 share is [s+ω ∗ d : s+ω ∗ d+p]. To summarize, for an ω-order masked implementation, the input data given to Mω i is a concatenation of ω + 1 p-point trace intervals [s + (j − 1) ∗ d : s+(j − 1) ∗ d+p], for j ∈ {1, . . . , ω + 1} corresponding to the ith bit of shares x1, . . . , xω+1. Fig. 4 (a) and (b) show examples for the fourth- and fifth-order masked implementations, respectively. The black dashed lines show the borders where the shares are concatenated. 5.4 Leakage analysis We found that the leakage of message bits in masked_poly_frommsg() procedure is non-uniform. The first bit of each message byte leaks considerably stronger than the last one. This is apparent from the difference in the success rate of neural network models which recover these bits. For example, for the first-order masked implementation, the difference between the mean empirical probabilities to recover the bit 0 and the bit 7 is 9%. We address this issue by applying cyclic rotations to shift the bits which leak less to the bit positions which leak more. The method is described in Section 6.1. 6.

For the attacks on implementations with masking orders ω ≤ 3, we start training from a network with a standard random weight distribution. For ω > 3, the recursive learning method is used. We cut-and-join training traces byte-wise using the technique of [27]. The resulting extended by a factor of 32 set is used to train two universal models, Mω 0 and Mω 1 , which recover the first and the second bit of each message byte (bits with the strongest leakage). For the first-order masked implementation, we also train the models M1 i for bits i ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, in order to quantify the difference between approaches with and without cyclic rotations. The neural networks are trained with a batch size of 1024 for a maximum of 100 epochs using early stopping with patience 20. We use Nadam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01 and a numerical stability constant epsilon = 1e-08. Binary cross-entropy is used as a loss function to evaluate the network classification error. 70% of the training set is used for training and 30% is left for validation. Only the model with the highest validation accuracy is saved. 6 Attack stage This section describes our attack strategy. The main difference from previous attacks of masked implementations of LWE/LWR PEK/KEMs [27,28,30] is the cyclic rotation method which we use to compensate for the non-uniformity of leakage in masked_poly_frommsg() procedure. 12 Elena Dubrova, Kalle Ngo, and Joel Gärtner 6.1 Cyclic rotation method It is known that a message of a ring-based LWE/LWR can be cyclically rotated by manipulating the corresponding ciphertext. Such a possibility was first described in [31] where it was hypothesised that rotations may be useful in sidechannel attacks. Since then two attacks utilizing cyclic rotations were presented. The first is the template side-channel attack on an unprotected software implementation of CRYSTAL-Kyber presented in [41]. It uses cyclic message rotations to construct ciphertexts which are used during profiling to create templates for the intermediate states of the message decoding operation based on the Hamming weight model. At the attack stage, the templates are applied to recover messages during the encapsulation. The second is the deep learning-based attack on the first-order masked and shuffled software implementations of CRYSTAL-Kyber and Saber presented in [5]. It recovers a message m contained in a given ciphertext c by modifying c to negacyclically rotate m 128 times by two bits. At each rotation, two message bits with the shuffling indexes 0 and 255 are extracted using a neural network for bits recovery. Another neural network is used for recovering shuffling indexes of the bits. In the attacks presented in this paper, we negacyclically rotate a message three times by two bits to subsequently shift the last six bits of each byte to the positions of the two first bits. In this way, we make use of “more leaky” bit positions to extract the bit values with a higher probability. This allows us to increase the attack success rate. The rotation of a message is performed by manipulating the corresponding ciphertext. In CRYSTALS-Kyber, a ciphertext c = (u, v) consists of polynomials in the ring Zq[X]/(X256 + 1). If c is properly generated, a negacyclic rotation of the message can be performed by multiplying both u and v by indeterminate X [31]. However, as pointed out in [5], for chosen ciphertexts which are used in secret key recovery attacks, such a method may cause errors because decode(−y) and decode(y) can evaluate to different values. A method customized to specific chosen ciphertexts is presented in [5] as a solution to this problem. 7 Experimental results At the profiling stage, for each ω-order masked implementation of CRYSTALKyber, ω ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 5}, we capture from the device under attack 30K traces for the training of neural networks. The traces are captured during the execution of CCAKEM.Decaps() with input ciphertexts encrypting messages selected at random. Since CRYSTAL-Kyber is a public-key algorithm, the encryption is performed using the public key of the device under attack. Hence, the attacker can apply CPAPKE.Enc() to generate a proper ciphertext c for any message, and then use the device under attack to decrypt c. The training set is expanded to 960K using the byte-wise cut-and-join technique of [27]. 7.

The attack traces are captured with three two-bit negacyclic rotations for each message. Thus, 2.5K messages, selected at random, are tested in total. For the fifth-order masked implementation, we capture the attack set five times to evaluate the effect of repetitions on the success rate of message recovery. For the first-order masked implementations, we train eight models, M1 i , one for each bit position in a byte, for all i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , 7}. Table 2 shows that the resulting empirical probability of successful message bit recovery is too low, pbit = 0.97434, on average. This gives us only pmessage = p 256 bit = 0.00127 average message recovery probability. One can see that the prediction accuracy decreases towards the last bit of a byte. Then we apply cyclic rotations. For each test message, we capture traces with i two-bit cyclic rotations, for i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}.

N 1 3 5 pbit 0.97995 0.99763 0.99946 pmessage 0.00560 0.54530 0.87085 Using the fifth-order masked implementation, we capture test traces with five repetitions. As Tables 5 and 6 show, the repetitions boost the message recovery probability from 0.56% to 87%. We believe that such a significant increase is due to the fact that random masks are updated at each execution. This contributes to the independence of errors in the repeated measurements. Thus, ironically, something that is intended to make the attack harder actually makes it easier. 16 Elena Dubrova, Kalle Ngo, and Joel Gärtner 8 Conclusion We demonstrated side-channel attacks on up to the fifth-order masked software implementations of CRYSTALS-Kyber exploiting a vulnerability in the procedure masked_poly_frommsg() which is called during the re-encryption phase of decapsulation. The success of the attacks is due to the recursive learning neural network training method and cyclic rotation-based message recovery method introduced in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, no side-channel attack on a higher than the third order masked implementation of any LWE/LWR PKE/KEM scheme has been demonstrated until now. The presented approach is not specific for CRYSTALS-Kyber and can potentially be applied to other LWE/LWR PKE/KEM schemes. The recursive learning technique might have significance beyond side-channel attacks context. We are currently working on developing countermeasures against side-channel attacks on LWE/LWR PKE/KEM schemes.
https://abcnews.go.com/US/new-jerseys-ocean-city-taps-ai-gun-detection/story?id=102960788	New Jersey's Ocean City taps AI gun detection in hopes of thwarting mass shootings	"With decades of failed attempts at gun reform amid the frequency in mass shootings, some have sought alternative solutions through artificial intelligence.  The Ocean City School District in New Jersey, as well as the city's boardwalk, have implemented new technology developed by ZeroEyes, a company that says it uses AI, paired with human experts, to scan camera feeds for guns.  ""I don't think anybody should question or be fearful of an artificial intelligence program that's going to identify an immediate imminent threat of someone being shot or killed. You can't put a price tag on saving a life,"" Jay Prettyman, the police chief in Ocean City, told ABC News.  Prettyman said that AI gun detection could also serve as a deterrent from possible crime.  ""If we can put something in the place that we can advertise about – that can scare people from coming to Ocean City and coming to any of our schools, and we can push evil off to another day – that's what I think is our responsibility to do for our kids every day,"" Prettyman said.  PHOTO: Jay Prettyman is the Police Chief in Ocean City, NJ, a city that uses ZeroEyes technology on their boardwalk and in their three schools. Jay Prettyman is the Police Chief in Ocean City, NJ, a city that uses ZeroEyes technology on their boardwalk and in their three schools. ABC News Mass shootings have nearly tripled from 2022 to 2016, and there have already been over 480 mass shootings this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.  ""I'm 100% confident that we are going to have such a fast response compared to not having this system,"" Prettyman said. ""[It] is going to increase the opportunity of our officers to get into that building as quickly as possible and save lives.""  It's not just Ocean City that has partnered with ZeroEyes – the company says it has hundreds of clients in over 35 states, including Philadelphia's transportation system SEPTA and the United States Air Force.  ZeroEyes let ABC News into their headquarters outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to watch a demonstration of how their artificial intelligence system works. The company says their alert system– from AI detection to the dispatch of law enforcement – takes less than 30 seconds.  Clients give ZeroEyes access to their security camera feeds, and then ZeroEyes uses its AI technology to constantly scan for any object that appears to be a gun. Once it detects a gun, the company says it will send a screenshot back to ZeroEyes headquarters, where a group of analysts, consisting of former law enforcement and veterans, confirm whether the detection is a real threat or not. If the threat is confirmed, the ZeroEyes analysts dispatch an alert to the client and local law enforcement.  MORE: Radio broadcasters sound off on artificial intelligence ""Fifteen times more people die from gun violence in a given year than they do from fires in a building, but every building you walk into is going to have a smoke detector fire suppression system,"" ZeroEyes CEO and co-founder Michael Lahiff told ABC News' Ashan Singh. ""It's only a matter of time. We're going to have proactive solutions out there for active shooters, mass shootings, gun violence. And ZeroEyes is going to set the bar for that standard.""  But experts caution that artificial intelligence is only as good as the data put into it.  ""If the data coming into the computer that's using artificial intelligence is flawed or incomplete, the judgments and the analysis created by the computer will be flawed or incomplete as well,"" said John Cohen, ABC News contributor and former acting undersecretary for Intelligence at the Department of Homeland Security.  ""If it works right, it can help save lives,"" Cohen added. ""If it doesn't work right, if it creates a lot of false positives. It could actually be a distraction to response efforts and that can mean more lives lost.""  According to Lahiff, the company has never sent a false alarm to a client. Lahiff credits this record to the human analysts that double check their AI, who are staffed 24/7, 365 days a year, and the data put into the system.  PHOTO: Artificial intelligence is only as good as the data used to teach the machine. ZeroEyes has created a green screen room to train their AI to spot guns. Artificial intelligence is only as good as the data used to teach the machine. ZeroEyes has created a green screen room to train their AI to spot guns. ABC News Lahiff showed ABC News the green screen lab that ZeroEyes has created it says to train their AI. It's a bright green room from floor to ceiling, with hundreds of security cameras at all different heights on the walls. In an attached room, they have an armory of fake guns which they brandish in front of the cameras to help refine what the AI can detect. Lahiff says there are millions of images in their data set.  The wave of AI tools developed for surveillance purposes has raised questions about accuracy, privacy, and bias, as well as calls for regulation. The ACLU has criticized AI technology generally for programming racial biases into systems, especially with facial recognition.  Lahiff says ZeroEyes technology only focuses on guns being wielded dangerously.  ""We're not we're not collecting biometric data on people,"" Lahiff said. ""We're not collecting faces or names or anything like that. It's just looking for an object, looking for a gun.""  Lahiff says his company isn't a complete solution to the mass shooting problem that the United States faces.  ""We're not the cure-all for this,"" Lahiff said. ""You have to have good security and layers.""  PHOTO: Michael Lahiff is the CEO and Co-Founder of ZeroEyes, a company that has created artificial intelligence to scan security cameras for anyone carrying a gun. Michael Lahiff is the CEO and Co-Founder of ZeroEyes, a company that has created artificial intelligence to scan security cameras for anyone carrying a gun. ABC News ""Even under the best of circumstances, an artificial intelligence enabled early detection system will only save lives when it's part of a multi-layered security capability,"" Cohen said. ""Schools still need to have active shooter plans in place. There still needs to be physical security in place that prevents or impedes an attacker from gaining access. You're still going to have to have protocols in place to protect potential victims inside the location.""  Some experts are mindful of the possible downsides to using technology in this way.  Odis Johnson Jr., PhD, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor and the Executive Director of Johns Hopkins Center for Safe and Healthy Schools, has been researching the effects that AI can have on students. According to his studies, students can feel surveillance, which results in less academic achievements and a lower likelihood of attending college.  MORE: Video Teachers prepare for AI in the classroom ""98, 99% of them will never experience school violence, but yet they live under a system in which they're treated as a suspect first and a student second,"" Johnson Jr. told ABC News.  According to Johnson Jr., there is only one true solution to the problem of mass shootings in the United States.  ""The country needs gun policy reform,"" he said. ""And again, this is something that puts the problem of gun violence and mass shootings in the laps of policymakers more so than the public, because the public is in agreement on a large number of ways that we might mitigate access to guns, to people who don't need them, people who would perpetuate or perpetrate no people who would cause issues that will cause harm to others.""  For Prettyman, ZeroEyes presents a possibility to collapse law enforcement's response time, which can result in lives saved.  ""You can't stop evil,"" Prettyman said. ""You have to do the best you can to prevent where it's going to happen and be prepared to respond once it does."""
https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2023/08/25/chatgpt-calls-scholarship-not-panic-opinion	ChatGPT Calls for Scholarship, Not Panic	hatGPT usage declined 10 percent in June, sparking a flurry of speculation that the bloom is off the rose for the chat bot. But that analysis overlooked what’s probably obvious to most academics: the spring semester ended in May.  So, what should we expect this fall when our students log back on? According to Ethan Mollick, we are facing a “homework apocalypse.” Mollick’s eye-catching title belies the fact that his essay offers a sober, thoughtful discussion of how AI may affect academic assessment in the fall.  Other writers are less measured. Inara Scott declares, “Yes, We Are in a (ChatGPT) Crisis”! Sounding the siren call of panic, Scott calls ChatGPT an existential crisis for the university. Expressing her shock at the lack of concern that faculty members seem to have about ChatGPT’s impact on education, Scott declared, “This type of apathy is unacceptable. Our students deserve better, and frankly, the entire world needs us to care.”  Most Popular WVU abandons award-winning global education (opinion) A new report makes Texas A&M reconsider ex-president's plans WVU abandons award-winning global education (opinion) This kind of catastrophic thinking has become all too common in the academic press and department meetings. Joseph M. Keegin, for example, calls ChatGPT “a plagiarism machine.” Yet articles like Scott’s and Keegin’s rarely offer substantive evidence. In Keegin’s case, we’re told that some instructors reported “encountering student work … that smelled strongly of AI generation.” A strong smell is not evidence of widespread practice. Yet on the basis of this, Keegin demands that administrators create a strong anti–AI plagiarism policy, apparently overlooking the fact that plagiarism policies should be the purview of faculty.  I’m not naïve about students’ willingness to cheat, especially given the pressures they are under. And it may be a fact that students are using the chat bot extensively. But faculty have an ethical obligation to know that students are using AI and to know how and why they are using it before they make dramatic changes to their curricula. In addition to the ethical obligation, it’s just plain foolish to make major changes to our curriculum—let alone redesign the structure of the university, as Scott calls for—without any concrete data about how students are engaging with AI. In one of the more perceptive articles on AI and education, Andrea L. Guzman points out that students themselves will have a wide range of responses to AI, and we shouldn’t make the mistake of thinking they will all rush right out and embrace the technology.  Guzman’s portrait of the varied nature of student engagement with ChatGPT matches my own experience last semester, when I did not see an increase in error-free or garbled syntax–free writing. In my online Introduction to American Literature course, the average grade on the first formal essay was about a B-minus, which is typical, going back many years, for first essay assignments. My students’ formal writing and discussion posts were still filled with as many comma errors, dangling modifiers, cohesion problems, missing apostrophes and capitalization errors as they’ve always been, which is exactly what I would expect to see in a class with students wrestling with new intellectual concepts and unfamiliar forms of writing. And this was a class where I introduced AI and discussed with students the ethics of using it in their writing.  This summer, I taught an online course on grammar, which I also taught in the spring. In March, ChatGPT struggled to accurately complete the exercises I fed it, but when I resubmitted those exercises in July, I noticed a marked improvement in the bot’s ability to identify the different components of sentences. My students could easily have been using ChatGPT to complete the assignments. But their work looked the same as it did in the spring, or in the many iterations of this course that I taught before ChatGPT arrived.  Yet there are students who claim that ChatGPT usage is widespread. Owen Kichizo Terry, an undergraduate student at Columbia University, paints a portrait of students wholeheartedly using ChatGPT to sidestep the need for critical thinking. Perhaps, but we shouldn’t use Terry’s description of how students are using AI as a representation of what’s happening across campuses in America. It might be possible for the average student at Columbia to simply rewrite what ChatGPT produces to make it “flow better,” but for many college students, revision is difficult, and blending documents with distinct voices and styles into a cohesive whole is a daunting task. Writing instructors have long known that students are reluctant to revise for a number of complex reasons, ranging from a weak understanding of the subject to a lack of a clear argument to an inability to imagine a particular sentence in another syntactical form. When ChatGPT spits out a response, all those problems are still there.  Further, while I don’t know the actual assignment Terry was given, the question he asked ChatGPT—“Write a six-page close reading of The Iliad”—is one most veteran instructors would recognize as so broadly constructed as to invite plagiarism. And the process that Terry describes differs only in degree from that of a student surfing SparkNotes or Shmoop for ideas. This isn’t something new, and faculty have long had a proven array of strategies to make their assignments less susceptible to this kind of plagiarism; a quick search for “antiplagiarism strategies” will take you to a host of handouts from teaching and learning centers across the country. Ideas like these apply to the ChatGPT world just as much as they did the pre-AI world we lived in last fall.  The whole notion of approaching the advent of chat bots as an emergency or crisis or apocalypse is a bad idea that will lead to bad policies and practices that aren’t based on evidence. Instead, we in the university need to approach this as what it is: an intellectual problem that needs a thoughtful, judicious response. We need to use the methodologies of academic disciplines to figure out what AI can do, how students are engaging with it and how it interacts with existing forms of knowledge production.  Doing that requires, well, scholarship. We need to study people’s (including students’) attitudes toward AI. We need to study AI’s impacts on social organizations. We need to explore how chat bots work as writing tools and, just as important, how people are actually using them as writing tools in a wide range of situations, both in and outside the academy. This requires employing the methodologies and knowledge bases of a wide range of disciplines, including communication, psychology, sociology, economics, English, composition, education, business and more, in addition to the STEM fields that were engaged with AI long before ChatGPT came along. As this scholarship emerges, we will have a clearer understanding of what we are dealing with and how it impacts our pedagogical practices. At that point, we will be able to formulate sensible, effective responses that help our students achieve and thrive in this new environment.  But scholarship takes time. So what should we do in the meantime? First, don’t panic. Don’t assume all your students are cheating. Don’t revamp the way you assess students based on heated speculation.  Do familiarize yourself with ChatGPT and other bots. And keep familiarizing yourself with them, as they gain new capabilities regularly. And I’m not just talking about increasing linguistic capabilities or improvements in factual accuracy. We’re already seeing the first wave of ChatGPT apps appearing, including this one, which reads PDFs. Most of these early apps are clunky, but that will no doubt change soon. Also, OpenAI recently announced the ability to create URLs for particular chats. This is a significant development, because it makes it much easier for students to share their interactions with ChatGPT. Assigning and assessing exercises using ChatGPT just became much easier and more transparent.  Finally, do craft assignments that make plagiarism less likely; this is a good idea whether or not students are using AI.  I do not know what AI means for the future of writing instruction or college-level writing writ large. But neither does the author of the last article you read on AI, nor the author of the next article you will read. There are just too many uncertainties. And while moments of change like this make us more eager to find soothsayers and prophets who will tell us what the future holds, as scholars and teachers we should, in times like these, be more skeptical of the clairvoyants and Cassandras. And even if this is a crisis, our best response as academics will be to do what we do best: careful, thoughtful scholarship.

https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-has-started-to-let-people-think-for-themselves/	TikTok Is Letting People Shut Off Its Infamous Algorithm—and Think for Themselves	TIKTOK RECENTLY ANNOUNCED that its users in the European Union will soon be able to switch off its infamously engaging content-selection algorithm. The EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) is driving this change as part of the region’s broader effort to regulate AI and digital services in accordance with human rights and values.  TikTok’s algorithm learns from users’ interactions—how long they watch, what they like, when they share a video—to create a highly tailored and immersive experience that can shape their mental states, preferences, and behaviors without their full awareness or consent. An opt-out feature is a great step toward protecting cognitive liberty, the fundamental right to self-determination over our brains and mental experiences. Rather than being confined to algorithmically curated For You pages and live feeds, users will be able to see trending videos in their region and language, or a “Following and Friends” feed that lists the creators they follow in chronological order. This prioritizes popular content in their region rather than content selected for its stickiness. The law also bans targeted advertisement to users between 13 and 17 years old, and provides more information and reporting options to flag illegal or harmful content.  WIRED OPINION ABOUT Nita Farahany is the author of The Battle for Your Brain: Defending the Right to Think Freely in the Age of Neurotechnology (St. Martin’s Press 2023) and Robinson O. Everett Professor of Law and Philosophy at Duke University.  In a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, Big Data, and digital media, the urgent need to protect cognitive liberty is gaining attention. The proposed EU AI Act offers some safeguards against mental manipulation. UNESCO’s approach to AI centers human rights, the Biden Administration’s voluntary commitments from AI companies addresses deception and fraud, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has incorporated cognitive liberty into its principles for responsible governance of emerging technologies. But while laws and proposals like these are making strides, they often focus on subsets of the problem, such as privacy by design or data minimization, rather than mapping an explicit, comprehensive approach to protecting our ability to think freely. Without robust legal frameworks in place worldwide, the developers and providers of these technologies may escape accountability. This is why mere incremental changes won't suffice. Lawmakers and companies urgently need to reform the business models on which the tech ecosystem is predicated.  A well-structured plan requires a combination of regulations, incentives, and commercial redesigns focusing on cognitive liberty. Regulatory standards must govern user engagement models, information sharing, and data privacy. Strong legal safeguards must be in place against interfering with mental privacy and manipulation. Companies must be transparent about how the algorithms they’re deploying work, and have a duty to assess, disclose, and adopt safeguards against undue influence.  Much like corporate social responsibility guidelines, companies should also be legally required to assess their technology for its impact on cognitive liberty, providing transparency on algorithms, data use, content moderation practices, and cognitive shaping. Efforts at impact assessments are already integral to legislative proposals worldwide, including the EU’s Digital Services Act, the US's proposed Algorithmic Accountability Act and American Data Privacy and Protection Act, and voluntary mechanisms like the US National Institute of Standards and Technology’s 2023 Risk Management Framework. An impact assessment tool for cognitive liberty would specifically measure AI’s influence on self-determination, mental privacy, and freedom of thought and decisionmaking, focusing on transparency, data practices, and mental manipulation. The necessary data would encompass detailed descriptions of the algorithms, data sources and collection, and evidence of the technology's effects on user cognition.  Tax incentives and funding could also fuel innovation in business practices and products to bolster cognitive liberty. Leading AI ethics researchers emphasize that an organizational culture prioritizing safety is essential to counter the many risks posed by large language models. Governments can encourage this by offering tax breaks and funding opportunities, such as those included in the proposed Platform Accountability and Transparency Act, to companies that actively collaborate with educational institutions in order to create AI safety programs that foster self-determination and critical thinking skills. Tax incentives  could also support research and innovation for tools and techniques that surface deception by AI models.  Technology companies should also adopt design principles embodying cognitive liberty. Options like adjustable settings on TikTok or greater control over notifications on Apple devices are steps in the right direction. Other features that enable self-determination—including labeling content with “badges” that specify content as human- or machine-generated, or asking users to engage critically with an article before resharing it—should become the norm across digital platforms.  The TikTok policy change in Europe is a win, but it’s not the endgame. We urgently need to update our digital rulebook, implementing new laws, regulations, and incentives that safeguard user’s rights and hold platforms accountable. Let’s not leave the control over our minds to technology companies alone; it’s time for global action to prioritize cognitive liberty in the digital age.
https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/sep/19/google-deepmind-ai-tool-assesses-dna-mutations-for-harm-potential	Google DeepMind AI tool assesses DNA mutations for harm potential	Scientists at Google DeepMind have built an artificial intelligence program that can predict whether millions of genetic mutations are either harmless or likely to cause disease, in an effort to speed up research and the diagnosis of rare disorders.  The program makes predictions about so-called missense mutations, where a single letter is misspelt in the DNA code. Such mutations are often harmless but they can disrupt how proteins work and cause diseases from cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell anaemia to cancer and problems with brain development.  The researchers used AlphaMissense to assess all 71m single-letter mutations that could affect human proteins. When they set the program’s precision to 90%, it predicted that 57% of missense mutations were probably harmless and 32% were probably harmful. It was uncertain about the impact of the rest.  Based on the findings, the scientists have released a free online catalogue of the predictions to help geneticists and clinicians who are either studying how mutations drive diseases or diagnosing patients who have rare disorders.  A typical person has about 9,000 missense mutations throughout their genome. Of more than 4m seen in humans, only 2% have been classified as either benign or pathogenic. Doctors already have computer programs to predict which mutations may drive disease but because the predictions are inaccurate, they can only provide supporting evidence for making a diagnosis.  Writing in Science, Dr Jun Cheng and others describe how AlphaMissense performs better than current “variant effect predictor” programs and should help experts pinpoint more swiftly which mutations are driving diseases. The program may also flag mutations that have not previously been linked to specific disorders and guide doctors to better treatments.  The AI is an adaptation of DeepMind’s AlphaFold program, which predicts the 3D structure of human proteins from their chemical makeup.  AlphaMissense was fed data on DNA from humans and closely related primates to learn which missense mutations are common, and therefore probably benign, and which are rare and potentially harmful. At the same time, the program familiarised itself with the “language” of proteins by studying millions of protein sequences and learning what a “healthy” protein looks like.  When the trained AI is fed a mutation, it generates a score to reflect how risky the genetic change appears to be, though it cannot say how the mutation causes any problems.  “This is very similar to human language,” Cheng said. “If we substitute a word in an English sentence, a person familiar with English can immediately see whether the word substitution will change the meaning of the sentence or not.”  Prof Joe Marsh, a computational biologist at Edinburgh University who was not involved in the work, said AlphaMissense had “great potential”.  “We have this issue with computational predictors where everybody says their new method is the best,” he said. “You can’t really trust people, but [the DeepMind researchers] do seem to have done a pretty good job.”  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape  Free weekly newsletter Alex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives   Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Prof Ben Lehner, senior group leader in human genetics at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said the Al’s predictions need to be verified by other scientists but it seemed good at identifying which DNA changes cause disease and which do not.  “One concern about the DeepMind model is that it is extremely complicated,” Lehner said. “A model like this may turn out to be more complicated than the biology it is trying to predict. It’s humbling to realise that we may never be able to understand how these models actually work. Is this a problem? It may not be for some applications, but will doctors be comfortable making decisions about patients that they don’t understand and can’t explain?  “The DeepMind model does a good job of predicting what is broken,” he added. “Knowing what is broken is a good first step. But you also need to know how something is broken if you want to fix it. Many of us are very busy generating the massive data needed to train the next generation of AI models that will tell us not only which changes in DNA are bad but also exactly what the problem is and how we might go about fixing things.”  I hope you appreciated this article. Before you move on, I was hoping you would consider taking the step of supporting the Guardian’s journalism.   From Elon Musk to Rupert Murdoch, a small number of billionaire owners have a powerful hold on so much of the information that reaches the public about what’s happening in the world. The Guardian is different. We have no billionaire owner or shareholders to consider. Our journalism is produced to serve the public interest – not profit motives.  And we avoid the trap that befalls much US media – the tendency, born of a desire to please all sides, to engage in false equivalence in the name of neutrality. While fairness guides everything we do, we know there is a right and a wrong position in the fight against racism and for reproductive justice. When we report on issues like the climate crisis, we’re not afraid to name who is responsible. And as a global news organization, we’re able to provide a fresh, outsider perspective on US politics – one so often missing from the insular American media bubble.   Around the world, readers can access the Guardian’s paywall-free journalism because of our unique reader-supported model. That’s because of people like you. Our readers keep us independent, beholden to no outside influence and accessible to everyone – whether they can afford to pay for news, or not.

https://annualreport.mbari.org/2022/story/unlocking-the-power-of-ai-for-ocean-exploration	Unlocking the power of AI for ocean exploration	In order to manage impacts from climate change and other threats, researchers urgently need to learn more about the ocean’s inhabitants, ecosystems, and processes. As scientists and engineers develop advanced robotics that can visualize marine life and environments to monitor changes in the ocean’s health, they face a fundamental problem: The collection of images and video, or visual data, vastly exceeds researchers’ capacity for analysis.  A collaborative effort between MBARI and other research institutions is leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to accelerate efforts to study the ocean.  FathomNet—co-founded by MBARI, Ocean Discovery League, and CVision AI—is an open-source image database that uses state-of-the-art data processing algorithms to help process the backlog of visual data. Using artificial intelligence and machine learning will alleviate the bottleneck for analyzing underwater imagery and accelerate important research around ocean health.   FathomNet is an open-source image database that uses state-of-the-art data processing algorithms to help process the backlog of visual data. Image courtesy of FathomNet  Recent advances in machine learning enable fast, sophisticated analysis of visual data, but the use of artificial intelligence in ocean research has been limited by the lack of a standard set of existing images that could be used to train algorithms to recognize and catalog underwater objects and life. FathomNet addresses this need by aggregating images from multiple sources to create a publicly available, expertly curated underwater image database.  Why it matters As researchers develop advanced robotics to visualize marine life and environments, the collection of images and video vastly exceeds the capacity for analysis. Artificial intelligence can help process the backlog of visual data to alleviate this bottleneck. To jumpstart the collection, FathomNet is seeded with data that represents a subset of MBARI’s data repository, as well as assets from National Geographic and NOAA.  Over the past 35 years, MBARI has recorded nearly 28,000 hours of deep-sea video and collected more than 1 million deep-sea images. This trove of visual data has been annotated in detail by research technicians in MBARI’s Video Lab, who are experts in the field of visual taxonomy. MBARI’s video archive includes approximately 8.2 million annotations that record observations of animals, habitats, and objects. This rich dataset is an invaluable resource for researchers at the institute and collaborators around the world.   “A big ocean needs big data. Researchers are collecting large quantities of visual data to observe life in the ocean. How can we possibly process all this information without automation? Machine learning provides an exciting pathway forward.” —MBARI Principal Engineer Kakani Katija  The National Geographic Society’s Exploration Technology Lab has been deploying versions of its autonomous benthic lander platform, the Deep Sea Camera System, since 2010, collecting more than 1,000 hours of video data from locations in all ocean basins and in a variety of marine habitats. These videos have subsequently been ingested into CVision AI’s cloud-based collaborative analysis platform and annotated by subject-matter specialists at the University of Hawaii’s Deep-Sea Fish Ecology Lab and OceansTurn.  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Ocean Exploration began collecting video data with a dual remotely operated vehicle system aboard NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer in 2010. More than 271 terabytes are archived and publicly accessible from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). NOAA Ocean Exploration originally crowd-sourced annotations through volunteer participating scientists, and began supporting expert taxonomists in 2015 to more thoroughly annotate collected video.  With data from MBARI and the other collaborators as the backbone, the team hopes FathomNet can help accelerate ocean research at a time when understanding the ocean is more important than ever. MBARI launched a pilot program to use FathomNet-trained machine-learning models to annotate video captured by remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs). Using AI algorithms reduced human effort by 81 percent and increased the labeling rate tenfold. As an open-source web-based resource, other institutions can contribute to and use FathomNet instead of employing traditional, resource-intensive efforts to process and analyze visual data.    FathomNet aggregates images from MBARI and other institutions to create a publicly available, expertly curated underwater image training database. FathomNet will help unlock the power of artificial intelligence to accelerate the processing of ocean imagery. Image: © 2020 MBARI  Machine-learning models trained with FathomNet data also have the potential to revolutionize ocean exploration and monitoring. For example, outfitting robotic vehicles with cameras and improved machine-learning algorithms is already enabling automated search and tracking of marine animals and other underwater objects.  As of February 2023, FathomNet contained 90,086 images, representing 181,859 localizations from 81 separate collections for 2,243 concepts, with additional contributions ongoing. FathomNet aims to obtain 1,000 independent observations for more than 200,000 animal species in diverse poses and imaging conditions—eventually more than 200 million total observations. For FathomNet to reach its intended goals, significant community engagement—including high-quality contributions across a wide range of groups and individuals—and broad database utilization will be needed.

FathomNet: A global image database for enabling artificial intelligence in the ocean. Scientific Reports, 12: 15914. doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-19939-2 While FathomNet is a web-based platform built on an API where people can download labeled data to train novel algorithms, it will also serve as a community where ocean explorers and enthusiasts from all backgrounds can contribute their knowledge and expertise and help solve challenges related to ocean visual data that are impossible without widespread engagement.  To join the FathomNet community, visit fathomnet.org and follow @FathomNet on Twitter.  FathomNet forms the foundation for a larger initiative to use AI for ocean exploration.  Last fall, the National Science Foundation (NSF) awarded MBARI $5 million for Ocean Vision AI, a new program that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to accelerate processing of—and access to—ocean video and imagery to enable effective marine stewardship.  Ocean Vision AI combines the expertise of MBARI, the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS), Climate Change AI, CVision AI, Ocean Discovery League, and Purdue University, to create a machine-learning platform that will aid the processing of underwater visual data with a globally integrated network of services, tools, and diverse community of users. Multidisciplinary collaborators and supporting team members that include data scientists, oceanographers, game developers, and human-computer interaction experts will streamline access and analysis of ocean visual data to promote effective marine stewardship. Ocean Vision AI’s scope goes beyond data aggregation and processing pipelines. This project will also develop a video game to cultivate a community of ocean enthusiasts that can help improve machine-learning models and contribute directly to ocean exploration and discovery.  Analyzing visual data—particularly data with complex scenes and organisms that require expert classifications—is a resource-intensive process that is not scalable in its current form. As more visual data are collected, the ocean community faces a data analysis backlog that artificial intelligence can help solve.   The new Ocean Vision AI program will:  Provide a central hub for groups conducting research using underwater imaging, artificial intelligence, and open data;   Create data pipelines for image and video data repositories;  Provide project tools for coordination;  Leverage public participation and engagement via game development; and   Generate data products shared with researchers and other open-data repositories.  Ocean Vision AI also seeks to build a global community, from enthusiasts to experts, around underwater visual data akin to an iNaturalist or eBird for the ocean.  The Ocean Vision AI project and FathomNet leverage the power of artificial intelligence to accelerate the processing of ocean imagery and ultimately enable effective management of ocean resources. Image: © 2021 MBARI Advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence can help process the deluge of data researchers are collecting about the ocean, but still require human intervention to train, evaluate, verify, and improve the performance of these algorithms. Ocean Vision AI will develop game-based human annotation pipelines to engage a broader audience. A video game will teach casual gamers about the ocean while improving machine-learning models and expanding annotated datasets.   A long-term goal of Ocean Vision AI is not only to accelerate ocean discoveries in video and imagery but also to provide these findings and the tools used to support them to a much wider section of the ocean community. Researchers studying ways to manage or conserve ocean resources, and anyone interested in what happens below the ocean surface, will be able to access the resulting verified annotations and trained algorithms via open-source platforms like FathomNet. In the future, this new technology has the potential to usher in real-time processing of ocean imagery, scaling up our observation capabilities using current and future robotic technologies.  Technology innovations like Ocean Vision AI and FathomNet are critical to accelerating the exploration of the ocean and addressing the long-standing challenge of enabling large-scale biological observations in the marine environment so we can sustainably manage and care for this incredible, shared resource.

https://hai.stanford.edu/news/analyzing-european-union-ai-act-what-works-what-needs-improvement#:~:text=The%20EU%20AI%20Act%20is,its%20position%20in%20mid%2DJune	Analyzing the European Union AI Act: What Works, What Needs Improvement	he EU AI Act is set to become the world's first comprehensive legal framework for artificial intelligence. Originally proposed by the European Commission in April 2021, the general approach policy was adopted by the European Council last year, and the European Parliament just adopted its position in mid-June. Now the three will negotiate the final details before the policy can become law — in a process called ”trilogue,” a three-way negotiation. After a final agreement, the law could become enforceable within the next few years.  Stanford HAI convened experts in artificial intelligence, law, and policy to explore the finer points of the regulation, what aspects may still be up for negotiation between the three EU institutions, what’s missing, and how likely technology companies will be able to follow it. Here are the highlights of their discussion, moderated by Marietje Schaake, international policy fellow at Stanford HAI and international policy director at Stanford Cyber Policy Center, as well as a former member of the European Parliament. You can watch the full panel here.  Where are the areas of potential disagreement among the legislative bodies? Dragoș Tudorache is a Member of the European Parliament and co-rapporteur of the European Parliament for the AI Act on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties. He also chairs the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence in the Digital Age. MEP Tudorache highlighted the strong sense of political alignment. However, he expected several areas to surface during the trilogue.    AI use for biometric surveillance in public spaces. Parliament introduced prohibitions that limit law enforcement’s use, which are likely to be objected to by member state governments in council. Definition of high-risk AI. Parliament allows for a broader definition of use cases for high-risk AI, while the council would prefer to narrow that definition. Governance. The three will need to discuss, among other things, national silos in terms of implementation and enforcement, as well as levels of coordination. Other areas of disagreement, he noted, include generative AI regulation and assessments for high-risk applications after deployment.  Alex Engler is a fellow in Governance Studies at The Brookings Institution focusing on the implications of artificial intelligence and emerging data technologies for society and governance. He added that more technocratic elements will also be up for discussion: What types of agencies will be regulated, will existing agencies regulate their own expertise (i.e., education agencies handle education algorithms), or should they create a central organization? These technocratic pieces will need to be “worked out first because they’re the absolute core function of the law,” he said.  How close are companies to complying with the proposed regulations? Rishi Bommasani, society lead at the Stanford HAI Center for Research on Foundation Models and a PhD candidate of computer science, studied how foundation model providers, such as OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic, currently comply with the draft act. Areas where they miss the mark include providing a summary of copyrighted data being used to train models, uneven reporting of energy use, inadequate disclosure of risk mitigation, and an absence of evaluation standards or auditing procedures. Foundation model developers who adopt an open-source approach tend to fare better on resource disclosure requirements; whereas closed or restricted access models perform better on deployment-related requirements.  What isn’t in the act that should be? Bommasani noted first that the draft doesn’t consider model use. If something like ChatGPT is being used for medical applications or legal applications versus, say, entertainment purposes, this materially influences how much transparency and evaluation might be required. Secondly, while the act considers downstream uses of models, it doesn’t consider other aspects of the supply chain (dataset construction and training method, for example).  Finally, model access — and allowing researchers to assess and evaluate these tools — is paramount but currently lacking in the proposed AI Act. MEP Tudorache promised to take up the issue immediately in response.  What do technology companies need from policymakers to be able to comply? Companies need further clarification along three areas, says Irene Solaiman, policy director at Hugging Face, who conducts social impact research and leads public policy.  Transparency: Lawmakers must define the legal requirement for transparency and how to document data sets, models, and processes. Model access: Whether a model is open or closed source, researchers need access to systems to conduct evaluations and build safeguards. Impact assessments: The research community currently doesn’t have standards for what evaluation looks like. “There aren’t great ways to robustly evaluate even one aspect of bias for language models,” she said. How will the EU plans impact the U.S.? “There’s a growing disparity between the U.S. and the EU approach [to regulating AI],” Engler said. The EU has moved forward on laws around data privacy, online platforms and online e-commerce regulation, and more, while similar legislation is absent in the U.S.  He warns that the EU Act’s passage will make it harder for the U.S. to pass its own laws — companies don’t want two different sets of rules for two different markets. “Corporate interests will fight tooth and nail if you have two dramatically different standards for online platforms,” he said.  Engler advises U.S. lawmakers to understand the EU Act and look for standards they can align on to ensure laws are easy to implement.  Tudorache, who says he’s seen growing interest in regulation from D.C. policymakers, added, “If we’re aligned on standards, if we’re aligned on principles, even if we diverge in the level of details in our legislation, I think we have a good chance to build convergence between the U.S. and the EU.”

Technology forecaster Brian Roemmele makes a strong case for how generative AI can improve customer service — but also suggests ways to avoid potential pitfalls of this rapidly evolving technology. By Jim Marous, Co-Publisher of The Financial Brand, CEO of the Digital Banking Report, and host of the Banking Transformed podcast  Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe Now!  Stay on top of all the latest news and trends in banking industry.  Email Address   I accept the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy. The banking industry is in the very early days of exploring how generative AI models like ChatGPT can be applied to transform financial services. Many institutions are beginning to run small-scale pilot projects or proofs of concept to evaluate potential use cases in customer experience enhancements, back-office automation, risk assessment and fraud detection as well as product innovation. While generative AI offers benefits, financial institutions must also navigate challenges, minimizing potential flaws of this nascent technology.  brian-roemmele-MultiplexTo gain insightful commentary on both the tremendous potential benefits as well as inherent risks new AI capabilities could bring to banks and credit unions, we conducted a two-part interview with Brian Roemmele, a prominent thought leader and expert on digital innovation and emerging technologies, for the Banking Transformed podcast. He offered a balanced perspective on how financial institutions can embrace the upside of generative AI like ChatGPT while also carefully mitigating downside risks.

Image for 3 Keys to Unlocking a New Level of Brand & Data-Driven Growth 3 Keys to Unlocking a New Level of Brand & Data-Driven Growth Enhancing Customer Experiences with Personalized AI A major opportunity Roemmele highlighted during the interview is using ChatGPT and similar models to provide hyper-personalized customer service and advice. “Banking is absolutely ripe for conversational interfaces,” says Roemmele. “And what we’re seeing with some of these large language models is the ability to really create conversational experiences between consumers, small businesses and financial institutions.”  Roemmele envisions banks training individual AI models for each customer using their personal financial data and transaction history. Over time, these “personal banker bots” could gain deep insights into every customer’s unique circumstances to offer tailored recommendations on budgeting, investing, retirement planning and other financial challenges.  “Imagine a scenario with a financial institution where you’re talking to an interface that can understand your particular financial picture, make recommendations on how to allocate funds, think about planning for retirement or buying a house. Those types of conversational interfaces are coming.” — Brian Roemmele  The power of this technology is that the more the AI interacts with a specific customer over time, the more personalized it can become at understanding their preferences and tailoring recommendations. This stands in contrast to the often rigid and repetitive scripted conversations with current non-AI chatbots.  “If you do it with care and you do it with dignity and permission by offering value to the client, by understanding more of the dimension of the milestones in life that that client is going through, your ability to finely tether an output is phenomenal,” states Roemmele.  An added benefit of conversational AI is that, when customers do need help, AI agents can provide rapid answers by quickly parsing questions and referencing vast knowledge bases rather than making customers wait on hold for the next available human agent. Generative AI also provides value by proactively offering personalized product recommendations, money-saving tips and basic financial planning or investment guidance tailored specifically to each customer’s risk tolerance, time horizon, current holdings and other factors.  Finally, as Roemmele explains, by continuously analyzing previous interactions, AI chatbots can assess customer sentiment, identify pain points, and loop in human agents as required.

Intelligent systems like ChatGPT can take over high volume, routine tasks such as checking account openings, loan processing, customer onboarding and other workflows that today require extensive manual effort.  Large language models can also analyze and extract key data from documents like contracts, financial statements and customer emails much faster than any human. Additionally, generative AI allows for auto-generating various reporting such as financial, regulatory, management and more based simply on a few prompts, rather than having analysts spend hours compiling such reports manually.    “There’s tremendous potential in the back office where you may have some very manual processes, reconciling accounts, moving data from system to system. Those are things that could be highly automated by these large language models,” states Roemmele. Generative AI can expedite content creation by automatically generating blog posts, social media updates, marketing emails and other customer-facing copy tailored to banking by providing the system with high-level directional input.  Roemmele stresses that AI should be used to augment human capabilities rather than replace jobs. For instance, instead of coding from the ground up, bank developers can use AI conversationally to generate code and applications simply by describing requirements in plain language.  “AI should never be used to replace a single employee. AI should be used to empower employees to be 10 times, at very minimum, seven X more powerful. It’s like a lever. The more you give this person the ability to have the leverage of standing on the shoulders of AI, the more powerful that individual becomes within the organization.” — Brian Roemmele  Bottom line, by taking an empowerment-driven approach, banks can drive efficiency gains without the risks of mass job losses.

Yes and No  Building Guardrails to Mitigate Risks as Banks Adopt Generative AI During our two-part interview, Roemmele didn’t just focus on the benefits of Chat GPT and generative AI tools. He also extensively discussed risks that must be addressed, with model bias being a top concern.  “These models are only as good as the data we put into them,” Roemmele warns. “There could be areas where there’s bias built in. And that bias could play out in the recommendations made to consumers and small businesses.”  To mitigate bias issues, Roemmele recommended financial institutions build internal AI models trained only on their proprietary data. With the right processes, banks can minimize risk factors and keep AI outputs safe and productive. These processes include rigorous data governance practices to ensure data quality, accuracy and privacy. Second, Roemele recommends comprehensive model validation and testing procedures should be adopted to identify potential biases, errors or ethical concerns in AI-generated content. Additionally, continuous monitoring and auditing mechanisms can help detect and address any deviations or unexpected outcomes.    Roemmele further cautions that generative AI models can sometimes produce dangerous or nonsensical outputs if not constrained properly. He advises using a technique called “prompt engineering” to carefully frame queries and steer ChatGPT to give useful responses.  “The people who are most qualified to prompt AI are not technical people, and are not people from the AI community, because they see the model through a different lens. The people who I’ve found, and corporations are finding, (and they’re hiring these folks as soon as they are trained), are people with linguistics backgrounds and backgrounds in even poetry, ancient history, philosophy, psychology.” — Brian Roemmele  Collaboration between AI experts, legal professionals and domain specialists is crucial for creating well-defined ethical guidelines and ensuring compliance with industry regulations. By combining these measures, banks and credit unions can responsibly harness the power of generative AI while minimizing potential pitfalls and safeguarding their operations and reputation.

On one hand, being too cautious may cause banks to miss out on the tremendous advantages offered by ChatGPT and similar models. But on the other hand, rushing into deployment without enough testing and governance could lead to significant problems.  Roemmele shared that clear and transparent communication with customers regarding AI use can enhance trust and manage expectations. In addition, regular training and education for employees can promote a strong understanding of both the advantages and risks of generative AI as each employee will be impacted in some form going forward.  By fostering a culture of responsible AI adoption and staying agile in adapting to emerging challenges, financial institutions can optimize the benefits of generative AI while safeguarding their reputation and maintaining customer trust.  “This is an extraordinarily powerful technology, and we want to introduce it in a way that allows the benefits but also put some side rails on it. This has to be introduced in a very thoughtful and careful manner.” — Brian Roemmele  By embracing AI as a tool for empowering both employees and customers, while ensuring transparency, testing for bias and prioritizing ethics, banks can pave the way for conversational interfaces to transform financial services for the better. Roemmele sees a bright future for banking with AI, but only if the technology is harnessed judiciously.

This pathway allows clearance if the device is substantially equivalent to a former cleared device (ie, predicate). We analysed the predicate networks of cleared AI/ML-based medical devices (cleared between 2019 and 2021), their underlying tasks, and recalls. More than a third of cleared AI/ML-based medical devices originated from non-AI/ML-based medical devices in the first generation. Devices with the longest time since the last predicate device with an AI/ML component were haematology (2001), radiology (2001), and cardiovascular devices (2008). Especially for devices in radiology, the AI/ML tasks changed frequently along the device's predicate network, raising safety concerns. To date, only a few recalls might have affected the AI/ML components. To improve patient care, a stronger focus should be placed on the distinctive characteristics of AI/ML when defining substantial equivalence between a new AI/ML-based medical device and predicate devices. Introduction The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared an increasing number of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-based medical devices over the past 5 years.1,  2,  3 An example is the use of smart electrocardiogram (ECG) devices for estimating the probability of a heart attack.4 AI/ML-based medical devices involve new techniques or distinctive characteristics.4,  5,  6 In 2019, the FDA intensified discussions on policies in the clearance of these devices.4,  5,  6 There is no specific clearance pathway for AI/ML-based medical devices. On the basis of the risks of the devices, the FDA clears medical devices through three main pathways: approval through the premarket approval pathway, authorisation via the de novo premarket review, and clearance via the 510(k) pathway.3,  7 For simplicity, we use the term clearance to refer to the marketing authorisation of the devices via all pathways. The 510(k) pathway allows the clearance of a new medical device if the manufacturer shows that the device is substantially equivalent to one or more legally marketed devices (referred to as predicate devices). Predicate devices are other 510(k)-cleared devices, devices cleared through the de novo pathway, or devices initially cleared through the premarket approval that have been reclassified.8,  9,  10 Manufacturers might also refer to reference devices; however, these devices can be used only to support scientific methodology and are not considered as predicate devices.11 Devices cleared through the de novo pathway represent novel technologies in contrast to 510(k)-cleared devices.12,  13 A lenient interpretation of substantial equivalence facilitates clearance of generations of devices that claim substantial equivalence to each other with iterative design changes, resulting in devices dissimilar from original predicates—ie, predicate creep—posing safety risks to patients.2,  12,  14,  15,  16,  17 Scientists and policy makers have debated whether and how the 510(k) pathway should be restructured to improve the quality of devices for patients.15,  16,  18 For example, in 2021 the FDA introduced the Safer Technologies Program, a voluntary programme for medical devices and device-led combination products targeting an underlying disease or condition with the goal of providing patients with timely access while preserving statutory standards.19 The majority of AI/ML-based medical devices have been cleared through the 510(k) pathway.1,  3 To the best of our knowledge, the predicate networks of AI/ML-based medical devices cleared through the 510(k) pathway have not yet been systematically assessed. In this study, we analysed AI/ML-based medical devices and their predicate networks across medical specialties; more specifically we analysed length of time and number of generations until a de novo medical device or a non-AI/ML medical device was reached (including the role of reference devices and patterns in the reporting of technical terms attributable to AI/ML), tasks of the underlying AI/ML, and number of recalls. Methods Search strategy and selection criteria We used the FDA's publicly available list of AI/ML-based medical devices to identify all AI/ML-based devices cleared via the 510(k) pathway between Jan 9, 2019, and Dec 29, 2021, and included them in our primary study cohort.1 UJM and CB did the search, and all AI/ML-based devices cleared via the 510(k) pathway were included, with no restrictions. The FDA's 510(k) premarket notification and de novo databases served as data sources to identify the predicate devices of the devices included in our primary study cohort.20,  21 We (UJM and CB) identified the predicate devices for each device in the primary study cohort until a de novo or non-AI/ML-based predicate device was reached. Data extraction and analysis Predicate devices were identified by use of natural language processing in R, applying a similar method as a previous study that identified 510(k) predicate devices.22 In summary, we used 510(k) documents (ie, statement, summary, and decision summary) as input data and extracted the text using the tesseract package. From this text, we identified strings similar to the medical device control numbers (ie, 510[k] number, de novo number, and premarket approval number). We then removed duplicates and created a list of potential predicate devices associated with a medical device in our primary study cohort as the final output. To maximise the sensitivity of this method, we did not apply text cleaning or anchor keywords. Publicly accessible 510(k) documents were continuously web-scraped from the FDA's 510(k) premarket notification database and searched for predicate devices. In a manual data extraction process, UJM and CB (who have expertise in the field of AI/ML) independently assessed the automatically extracted predicate devices. Divergences were resolved through discussions between all authors. Devices that were falsely identified as predicates and duplicates were manually removed and devices that were missed by the automated extraction process were manually added. Each predicate device was assessed for whether it included an AI/ML component by use of the aforementioned FDA publicly available documents. These documents include information about the intended use and the technological characteristics.23 AI/ML tasks were also identified from these documents. There is no unified definition of AI.24 The FDA defines AI as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, and they outline that AI can use different techniques, such as models based on statistical analysis of data, expert systems that primarily rely on if–then statements, or machine learning.4 Whereas early AI systems were generally based on decision rules, recent AI research focuses on machine learning methods.25 Thus, aligned with our previous study,3 we considered only medical devices using machine learning as AI/ML-based medical devices. Machine learning can be implemented in a system that has the capacity to learn from training on a specific task by tracking performance measures.4 We categorised predicate devices as AI/ML, unclear AI/ML, or non-AI/ML. A device was qualified as AI/ML if the underlying AI/ML technique was explicitly stated (eg, deep learning neural networks for K203235; appendix p 11) or if the device was listed in the FDA's published list of AI/ML-based medical devices. A previous study showed that many AI/ML-based medical devices on the FDA published list (152 [44·3%] of 343 devices) did not mention AI/ML-related keywords in their 510(k) documents.26 To mitigate potential bias, we qualified devices that stated tasks usually solved by AI/ML at the time of their clearance as AI/ML when the documents allowed us to implicitly draw this conclusion (eg, stating arrhythmia analysis as the task at a time when this task was usually solved with machine learning27). Devices for which the documents described tasks that could have either been solved with or without AI/ML (eg, stating automatic segmentation as the task without information for the specific segmentation technique) were qualified as unclear AI/ML. Devices that did not meet the inclusion criteria for AI/ML or unclear AI/ML were considered as non-AI/ML. Additional information, especially reference devices, extracted from the FDA's 510(k) premarket notification and de novo database is listed in the appendix (p 1). We calculated the frequencies of explicit reporting of technical terms attributable to AI/ML in the publicly available documents to evaluate how the explicit reporting of these technical terms has evolved over time. We traced back the predicate networks of the primary AI/ML-based medical devices to a non-AI/ML-based predicate device, a predicate device with missing publicly available documents, or an underlying de novo device. We did not include reference devices in the predicate networks because they are not considered to be predicate devices.11 The first generation was defined as all predicate devices for which the devices in our primary study cohort claimed substantial equivalence for clearance, the second generation included all predicate devices for which the first-generation devices claimed substantial equivalence, and so on. We verified which AI/ML-based medical devices were affected by a recall by searching the openFDA Device Recalls data set.28 Ambiguities in the data extraction process were resolved by discussion between all authors. This study adheres to the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines. Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were calculated to assess the predicate networks of AI/ML-based medical devices in our study cohort. Differences in the number of predicate generations between medical specialties were analysed by use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and differences in the number of AI/ML tasks were analysed by use of the χ2 test. To avoid confounding, devices that occurred in more than one predicate network due to connections between the networks were counted only once. Two-tailed p values of less than 0·05 were considered to indicate significant differences. All statistical analyses were done in R, version 4.2.3. Results Overview of study cohort and medical specialties The complete study cohort with 755 medical devices was composed of the primary study cohort of 285 devices (AI/ML-based medical devices cleared by the FDA between Jan 9, 2019, and Dec 29, 2021) and their predicate networks, with 470 unique medical devices (456 cleared through the 510(k) pathway, 13 through the de novo pathway, and one through the premarket approval pathway; figure 1; appendix pp 2–15, 16–36). 85 (18·1%) of 470 devices were not identified in the automated extraction process, mainly because some of the FDA's publicly available documents referenced the predicate device only with a name but not with a K number. Figure thumbnail gr1 Figure 1Overview of AI/ML-based medical devices and predicate networks Show full caption View Large ImageFigure ViewerDownload Hi-res imageDownload (PPT) 237 (83·2%) of 285 devices of the primary study cohort were cleared for radiology, 26 (9·1%) were cleared for cardiovascular use, five (1·8%) were cleared for neurology, four (1·4%) were cleared for haematology, three (1·1%) were cleared for ophthalmology, three (1·1%) were cleared for microbiology, two (0·7%) were cleared for anaesthesiology, two (0·7%) were cleared for gastroenterology or urology, one (0·4%) was cleared for clinical chemistry, one (0·4%) was cleared for general hospital use, and one (0·4%) was cleared for obstetrics or gynaecology. For nearly a quarter (64 [22·5%] of 285) of the devices in the primary study cohort, the predicate devices could not be fully assessed, either because the publicly available information did not allow us to establish whether there was an AI/ML component or because no information was available in the databases. Predicate networks of AI/ML-based medical devices and duration until a de novo or non-AI/ML-based medical device The predicate networks of the primary AI/ML-based medical devices in the primary study cohort varied in complexity (figure 2). Nearly two-thirds (169 [59·3%] of 285) of the AI/ML-based medical devices in the primary study cohort were considered as substantially equivalent to a medical device with an underlying AI/ML technology in the first generation, a third (93 [32·6%]) were cleared on the basis of non-AI/ML-based medical devices in the first generation, and for the remaining devices (23 [8·1%]) it was unclear whether one of the predicate devices in the first generation could be qualified as an AI/ML device (figure 3).

The AI/ML-based medical device with the longest time and highest number of generations until a non-AI/ML-based predicate device was reached was the medical device K202527 (appendix p 10). This device is intended to capture, analyse, and report cardiac events and continuous ECG information for long-term monitoring. Its predicate network reaches back over 15 generations with many predicate devices with unclear AI/ML (figure 2A). Of the AI/ML-based medical devices in the primary study cohort, less than a quarter (65 [22·8%] of 285) could be traced back over one or more generations to a de novo cleared device. With one exception, for which it was unclear whether the de novo device had an AI/ML component (DEN130045), all de novo devices had an underlying AI/ML component. AI/ML-based medical devices for clinical chemistry and general hospital use did not have AI/ML predicate devices. The last device with an AI/ML component in the predicate networks for which substantial evidence was claimed was cleared in 2001 for haematology and radiology, 2008 for cardiovascular use, 2014 for neurology and obstetrics or gynaecology, 2016 for microbiology, 2018 for ophthalmic use, 2019 for anaesthesiology, and 2021 for gastroenterology or urology. When considering medical devices with unclear AI/ML components, predicate networks reached back to 1996 for cardiovascular devices and 2001 for anaesthesiology. No significant difference existed in the length of predicate networks between cardiovascular and radiological AI/ML-based medical devices (mean 2·1 generations [SD 1·4] vs 1·6 [SD 0·9] generations; p=0·20). Reporting bias of technologies attributable to AI/ML The explicit reporting of technical terms attributable to AI/ML in the publicly available documents decreased as the length of time that a clearance dated back increased. For all AI/ML devices, such technical terms were reported in the summaries for 86 (79·6%) of 108 devices cleared in 2021, for 82 (78·1%) of 105 devices cleared in 2020, and for 36 (44·4%) of 81 devices cleared in 2019, further decreasing over time (figure 4). Figure thumbnail gr4 Figure 4Reporting of AI/ML technologies in publicly available documents Show full caption View Large ImageFigure ViewerDownload Hi-res imageDownload (PPT) The AI/ML-based medical device that had the longest time since a predicate and had explicit reporting was an automatic haematology analyser cleared in 2001 (K003301; figure 2C, appendix p 18). The underlying technique was described as “standard mathematical methods, including deterministic artificial neural networks (ANN's) trained to distinguish between classes of white blood cells”.29 These findings suggest a reporting bias, where explicit use of AI/ML terminology has increased over time, which could be explained by the focus on AI by policy makers and regulators that has further evolved in the past 5 years. Tasks of AI/ML-based medical devices The AI/ML-based devices in the complete study cohort comprised a total of 191 different AI/ML tasks. The most frequent tasks were ECG arrhythmia analysis (62 devices), brain segmentation in MRI (17 devices), and notification of findings suggestive of intracranial haemorrhage in CT (14 devices). The proportion of task changes to number of predicate connections between the medical devices in the predicate network for each unclear AI/ML and AI/ML-based medical device in the study cohort varied between 0 (0 of 7 connections) for haematology and 0·48 (98 of 205 connections) for radiology. Compared with cardiovascular devices, radiological devices had a significantly higher proportion of task changes (0·478 vs 0·094; χ2=43·7, p<0·0001). In other words, radiological devices changed their AI/ML task approximately every second device (98 [47·8%] of 205 connections) and cardiovascular devices approximately every tenth device (10 [9·4%] of 106 connections). The FDA qualifies a device as substantially equivalent if, in comparison with a predicate, it (1) has the same intended use as the predicate and has the same technological characteristics as the predicate or (2) has the same intended use as the predicate, has different technological characteristics and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness, and the information submitted to the FDA shows that the device is as safe and effective as the legally marketed device.9 This framework leaves room for interpretation, and the FDA has applied discretion that is favourable to industry in its practices.15,  30 For example, in a previous study, the predicate networks of metal-on-metal hip implants were analysed and the results showed that their technological characteristics changed over time, including many different femoral stems, heads, and sleeves and 52 different acetabular components.15 The study also showed that the tasks of AI/ML-based medical devices changed over time. For example, the radiological device DEN170022 (appendix p 16), cleared to assist radiologists in the assessment and characterisation of breast abnormalities by use of MRI data, served as a predicate device for AI/ML-based medical devices in our primary study cohort that assessed and characterised brain tissue abnormalities by use of CT image data (K200760; appendix p 8), assessed and characterised incidentally detected pulmonary nodules by use of CT image data (K202300; appendix p 10), or served as an adjunct to diagnostic stress echocardiography for patients undergoing assessment for coronary artery disease (K201555; appendix p 9). This example shows that the intended use between a new device and its predicate device can vary. Previous studies focusing on non-AI/ML-based medical devices referred to this phenomenon as predicate creep.30,  31 Specifically for the AI/ML-based medical devices in our primary study cohort, this phenomenon could be explained to some extent by the FDA's broad classification of de novo devices, which serve as a generic category for further devices.32 The de novo device DEN170022 had the classification name “Computer-Assisted Diagnostic Software for Lesions Suspicious For Cancer”.33 This broad definition legitimised this de novo device as a predicate for all diagnostic software intended for tumour detection, irrespective of the specific tumour, the anatomical region of the tumour, or the diagnostic imaging method used. Another radiological example is DEN170073 (appendix p 16). This device was intended for the notification of findings suggestive for large vessel occlusion. AI/ML-based medical devices in our complete study cohort that directly used this device as a predicate device had other applications, such as the notification of suspicious findings in mammograms (K183285; appendix p 3) or intracranial haemorrhage in CT images (K180647, appendix p 30; K193658, appendix p 34). The de novo device was classified by the FDA as a “Radiological Computer-Assisted Triage And Notification Software”34 (DEN170073; appendix p 16), which, from a generous perspective, could serve as an explanation for the same intended use across these devices. However, the technological characteristics differed; for example, the devices for notification of large vessel occlusion of the brain (DEN170073) and suspicious findings in mammograms (K183285) were based on different radiological imaging methods and algorithms. Moreover, the disorders might have different levels of urgencies from a medical perspective. It is crucial to diagnose large vessel occlusions of the brain in a specific and short time window, whereas suspicious findings in mammograms, although important not to miss, allow more time until diagnosis and subsequent treatment. Previous studies have already raised safety concerns for the clearance of new devices based on predicate devices.15,  31,  35 These concerns can be amplified if the underlying technologies between the devices differ largely. Not all AI/ML-based medical devices and their predicates altered their tasks over time. As highlighted, cardiovascular devices changed their AI/ML task approximately every tenth device (9·4%). For example, the cardiovascular device K202527 (figure 2A), cleared in 2021, was intended for the detection of cardiac arrhythmias by use of ECG data. The device was traced back over many generations with sparse task changes. Another example is the radiological device K192065 (appendix p 5), cleared in 2019, which visualises and contours regions of the body, including organs at risk, to help the preparation and response assessment of treatments, such as those performed with radiation. This device was cleared on the basis of the predicate device K173635 (appendix p 30). The intended use was congruent between both devices. However, the new device had a deep learning-based approach that used an adversarial network for automatic contouring, whereas the predicate device did not contain such an AI/ML-based technology. The implementation of an AI/ML-based technology raises new questions regarding safety and effectiveness. For K192065, the mean Sørensen–Dice coefficient (ie, an overlap measure that can be used to compare manual and automatic contouring) was lowest for the prostate and rectum (appendix p 33). The precise contouring of these organs is crucial when undergoing radiation treatment for prostate cancer. An imprecise contouring could result in radiation-induced injury of the rectum. In summary, changes in the intended use and underlying technology in the predicate network of AI/ML-based medical devices are indications of a predicate creep and substantiate concerns about the evidentiary standards of the 510(k) pathway. The clearance process would benefit from a stronger and stricter focus on the distinctive characteristics of AI/ML when defining substantial equivalence to mitigate safety risks for patients. More specifically, one possible approach would be to restrict the classification description of de novo devices to the intended use, which would prevent the described predicate creep. Another possible approach would be to qualify AI/ML-based medical devices as substantially equivalent to predicate devices in terms of technological characteristics only if the new and predicate device have similar underlying AI/ML technology, because AI/ML technologies might raise new concerns in terms of safety and effectiveness. Role of reference devices 17 (18·3%) of 93 AI/ML-based medical devices in the primary study cohort that were cleared based on predicate devices without an AI/ML component referred to a reference device with an AI/ML component. For example, the intended use of the AI/ML-based medical device K211597 (appendix p 13) in the primary study cohort is diagnostic ultrasound imaging and fluid flow analysis of the human body. The underlying technology includes a machine learning algorithm. Both predicate devices (K201012 and K202216, appendix p 35) have an equivalent intended use, but the underlying technology is not AI/ML. The device K211597 also refers to a reference device (K200974). The reference device has the equivalent intended use and the underlying technology also includes a machine learning algorithm. The outlined results and example indicate that, for some AI/ML-based medical devices, the underlying AI/ML component was introduced solely through a reference device. The role of a reference device is to “support scientific methodology or standard reference values”.11 A reference device is not a predicate device and can be referred to only if the different technological characteristics of the devices do not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness.11,  36 The FDA outlined that software algorithms in AI/ML-based medical devices present unique considerations due to their complexity, and the FDA developed guiding principles specifically on good machine learning practice with the goal of helping to promote safe, effective, and high-quality medical devices that use AI/ML.6 To mitigate safety risks, it is advisable that AI/ML components of new medical devices are not introduced through reference devices. Recalls of AI/ML-based medical devices A total of 211 recalls affected 71 (9·4%) of 755 devices in the complete study cohort, including 14 (4·9%) of 285 AI/ML-based medical devices in the primary study cohort and 62 (13·2%) of 470 of the devices in the predicate networks. Of these recalls, the FDA designated two (0·9%) of 211 recalls as class III (ie, lowest risk), 209 (99·1%) as class II, and none as a class I recall (ie, highest risk).37 Most recalls affected radiological devices (180 [85·3%] of 211). For two devices, the recalls were presumably related to the AI/ML component K190387, a software for treatment planning and analysis of radiation therapy that was affected by a software error that could have resulted in local underestimation of expected dose (recall number Z-2341–2020). The second device was K200621 (figure 2D), a software used to process previously acquired transthoracic cardiac ultrasound images. This device was recalled due to the risk of an incorrect automated ejection fraction and image quality score estimate (recall number Z-2111–2021). A previous study that assessed the recalls of medical devices cleared through the 510(k) pathway between 2008 and 2017 identified a similar percentage of recalls (3012 [10·7%] of 28 246 devices).14 However, in our study, more than a third of the devices in the primary study cohort were cleared after 2020 (106 [37·2%] of 285; figure 1). This finding is important because the annual 510(k) recall rate is highest in the first 3 years after clearance (up to 1·9%) and is still prevalent up to 6 years after 510(k) decision (1·1%).38 Since we analysed recalls until December, 2022, medical devices in our primary study cohort that were cleared after 2020 might particularly be affected by a recall in 2023 or 2024. Of course, all medical devices in our primary study cohort could be affected by a recall later in time. In consequence, it is too early to establish whether AI/ML-based medical devices and their predicates are more often affected by recalls than are non-AI/ML-based medical devices, and further analysis is needed in the future. On a positive note, our study cohort did not include devices affected by class I recalls. A former study that assessed class I recalls reported that 510(k) devices have substantially higher risk of subsequent class I recalls when the clearance is based on predicate devices with a known history of class I recalls.39 Limitations A limitation of our study is that we used the FDA's list of cleared AI/ML-based medical devices, which might not be comprehensive.1 Thus, there might be cleared AI/ML-based medical devices that we did not include in our study cohort. Furthermore, there is no unified definition for AI/ML. Another definition might result in different predicate networks. Additionally, it was not always possible to establish whether a medical device was AI/ML-based, what the underlying task of the AI/ML components were, or if a recall affected the AI/ML component, because the publicly available information might not provide all information submitted to the FDA but rather only summarised information. Hence, it is possible that not all predicate AI/ML-based medical devices were identified. It would be helpful if more information was published. Lastly, we used the FDA's classification for medical specialties,40 but other classifications could be used. Conclusions and policy implications The predicate networks of cleared AI/ML-based medical devices varied in complexity and between medical specialties, with more than a third cleared on the basis of non-AI/ML-based medical devices in the first generation, and approximately only a quarter originating in a de novo cleared device across all generations. Especially for devices in radiology, the AI/ML tasks changed frequently along the device's predicate network, raising safety concerns. The findings indicate a predicate creep—ie, iterative design changes resulting in unproven devices dissimilar from original predicates—posing potential safety risks to patients. To date, only a few recalls might have affected the AI/ML components. One of the potential benefits of AI/ML-based medical devices is the ability to improve patient care. To unlock this potential, our findings suggest that a stronger and stricter focus should be placed on the distinctive characteristics of AI/ML and their tasks when defining substantial equivalence between a new AI/ML-based medical device and predicate devices. First, the classification description of de novo devices should be restricted to the specific intended use, which would prevent a predicate creep. Second, AI/ML-based medical devices should be qualified as substantially equivalent to predicate devices in terms of same technological characteristics only if the new and predicate device have a similar underlying AI/ML technology, because AI/ML technologies might raise new concerns in terms of safety and effectiveness. Third, it is advisable that AI/ML components of new medical devices are not introduced through reference devices.

We need to move beyond discussing what we can do and start focusing on how we can do it.”  The effects of climate change on Earth’s ecosystems are incredibly complex, and as part of our effort to use AI for solving some of the world’s most challenging problems, here are some of the ways we’re working to advance our understanding, optimise existing systems, and accelerate breakthrough science of climate and its effects.  Understand weather, climate, and their effects Better understanding the core problems and their effects is a critical first step to tackling climate change. Working together with the UK Met Office, we developed a precipitation nowcasting model to better understand changing weather. This nowcasting model is more accurate than the existing state of the art, and much preferred by the Met’s expert meteorologists. Our climate and weather research spans short-range (under two hours) to medium-range (ten days) forecasting, which can hugely impact how we optimise renewable energy systems that are based on natural resources.  From modelling the behaviour of animal species across the Serengeti to supporting machine learning projects that advance conservation projects in Africa, we’ve been helping scientists track and better understand the effects of climate change on ecosystems and biodiversity. Going forward, our team is also building upon AI systems used to identify bird song in Australia, helping advance tools that monitor changing wildlife at scale.  Moreover, we’re partnering with non-profit Climate Change AI to close important gaps in climate-related data. Currently, this partnership focuses on building a comprehensive wishlist of datasets whose availability would advance AI solutions for climate change. We’ll make this wishlist available to the wider public when it’s complete.  Optimise existing systems While we transition to more sustainable infrastructure, we need to optimise the systems the world depends on today. For example, today’s computing infrastructure, including AI itself, is energy-intensive. To help solve some of these issues, we’ve been developing AI that can enhance existing systems, including optimising industrial cooling and more efficient computer systems.  Given our energy grids are not yet running on clean energy, it's important we use our resources as efficiently as possible while we work on the transition to renewables. Accelerating the global transition to renewable energy sources can also greatly reduce carbon emissions.  In 2019, our climate & sustainability team collaborated with domain experts at a Google-owned wind farm to increase the value of wind energy – ultimately, aiming to support growth across the broader industry. By developing a custom AI tool to better predict wind power output and another model to recommend commitments to supply this anticipated energy to the electricity grid, this tool greatly boosted the value of the wind energy. Cloud is now developing a software product using this model, which is being piloted by French power company ENGIE.  “We’ll run out of time in the climate countdown if we don’t build solutions that are widely applicable.” ‍ – Sims Witherspoon, climate & sustainability lead Accelerate breakthrough science Beyond optimising our existing infrastructure, we need scientific breakthroughs to help us build a sustainable energy future. One particular area that holds great promise is nuclear fusion, an incredibly powerful technology with the potential to deliver limitless carbon-free energy. Fusion reactors are powered by a pressurised plasma of ionised hydrogen that is hotter than the core of the sun. The intense heat means this plasma can only be held by a rapidly adjusted magnetic field – a notoriously difficult engineering challenge.  Mastering the magnetic control of plasma is a fundamental part of solving the challenge to controlling the nuclear fusion process and harnessing the abundant green energy it could provide. So we collaborated with the Swiss Plasma Center at EPFL to develop an AI system that learned how to successfully predict and control plasma in a tokamak-style nuclear fusion reactor. And not merely to contain the plasma, but to 'sculpt' it into a range of experimental shapes.  Bring us your challenges To build effective AI solutions, researchers need a solid understanding of the challenges faced by people around the world. This includes getting access to data that’s representative of the problems, partnering with domain experts to make sure we’re building reliable systems, following policy guidance on regulatory structures, and finding real-world opportunities for testing these systems. For these reasons, collaboration with affected communities, scientists, industry professionals, regulators, and governments is central to our sustainability efforts.  If you are an industry domain expert or climate scientist with a specific challenge to solve that could help the world understand, mitigate, or adapt to climate change, our climate & sustainability team would love to hear from you.

Here’s how	The IRS is launching plans with boosted technology and artificial intelligence to collect unpaid taxes from higher earners, partnerships and large corporations, which could transform tax compliance or spark challenges for the agency, experts say.   After past criticisms of low audit rates among the wealthy, the IRS on Friday renewed plans to focus on higher-end enforcement, including expanded use of AI to examine large partnerships, such as hedge funds, real estate investors, law firms and more.  The agency also re-shared its promise not to increase audits for Americans making less than $400,000 a year, along with safeguards for low to moderate earners who claim the earned income tax credit and have seen elevated audit rates.

https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/24/31percent-of-investors-are-ok-with-using-ai-as-their-financial-advisor.html	31% of investors are OK with using artificial intelligence as their advisor	KEY POINTS Generative artificial intelligence is technology that uses algorithms to create new content. That can include financial advice, as well as things like essays, song lyrics and art. 31% of investors would be comfortable putting AI’s financial advice into practice without verifying it first, according to a CFP Board survey. AI outputs aren’t necessarily reliable all the time. It may also be difficult to know what questions to ask an AI chatbot, especially for those with complex financial lives. ChatGPT website displayed on a phone screen. Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images Nearly 1 in 3 investors would use artificial intelligence as their financial advisor, a new survey suggests — and that has the potential to lead to flawed advice, experts said.    Specifically, 31% of investors queried would be comfortable implementing financial advice from a generative AI program without first verifying those recommendations with another source, according to a poll by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, the body that governs the CFP designation for financial advisors.  “It is a bit concerning,” said Kevin Keller, CEO of the CFP Board.  In simple terms, AI is technology that aims to simulate human intelligence. Generative AI uses algorithms to create new content like essays, song lyrics, art, photography and computer code — or, in this case, financial advice.  ChatGPT, a program that went viral after being debuted to the public late last year, is one example of generative AI.  More from Personal Finance: Interest rates, inflation push Gen Z to trade on emotion 5 cities with the highest property tax rates 81% of full-time workers want a 4-day work week  Would-be financial-advice recipients can use such programs to ask financial questions or prompts.  Consider this sample prompt from Keller: “Create an asset allocation for a 62-year-old male investor who is moderately risk tolerant.”  The algorithms that underpin generative AI compile data from sources like the internet to develop responses, and those data sources may not be reliable. The quality of the results depend on the quality of the model, according to McKinsey & Co.  “The outputs aren’t always accurate — or appropriate,” the consulting firm wrote of generative AI.  “For its part, ChatGPT seems to have trouble counting, or solving basic algebra problems — or, indeed, overcoming the sexist and racist bias that lurks in the undercurrents of the internet and society more broadly,” it added.  In short, financial advice outputs won’t necessarily be 100% trustworthy.  'ChatGPT goes to Harvard': Student puts A.I. chatbot to the testWATCH NOW VIDEO05:15 ‘ChatGPT goes to Harvard’: Student puts A.I. chatbot to the test Of course, technology and algorithms aren’t new for investors — nor is the skepticism surrounding that technology.  So-called robo-advisors, which use algorithms to automate asset allocations for investors, began popping up around the time of the 2008 financial crisis. They’ve grown in popularity, inspiring questions as to whether they can deliver advice on par with human financial advisors.  Investors — especially those with relatively complicated financial lives — a face an additional hurdle with AI: Engaging with it becomes difficult if someone doesn’t know what questions to ask in the first place, wrote Michael Kitces, a CFP and head of planning strategy at Buckingham Wealth Partners.  “Have you tried logging into ChatGPT to ask it questions only to find yourself sitting there wondering, ‘What should I ask an AI chatbot?’ Kitces said. “Now imagine that feeling again, but this time you have to ask it the right question because your financial life savings are on the line.”  It’s the Wild West out there. Kevin Keller CEO OF THE CFP BOARD Perhaps counterintuitively, young investors seem more wary about AI outputs than older investors: 62% of investors age 45 and older said they were “very satisfied” with getting financial advice from generative AI, versus 38% of investors under 45, according to the CFP Board poll.  Yet older investors — who may be in or near retirement — are generally the ones with more complex finances and in need of more tailored advice, experts said.  Ultimately, there have always been do-it-yourself investors, and there will continue to be, Keller said. Those who leverage AI for financial advice should “trust but verify,” he said.  “It’s the Wild West out there,” he added.

Cramer said he sees AI as hugely meaningful for companies that deal with large amount of data, not those with consumer-oriented goals. I'm worried AI jumped the shark, says Jim CramerWATCH NOW VIDEO01:28 I’m worried AI jumped the shark, says Jim Cramer CNBC’s Jim Cramer on Monday suggested that Wall Street’s artificial intelligence craze may be reaching its peak.  Cramer wondered if AI is having a GoPro  moment as he compared companies touting AI offerings to the action camera fad years ago. He suspected that GoPro had jumped the shark when he saw an image of a goat riding a surfboard with a camera attached to its head. Soon enough, the company’s stock tumbled from its highs, never to return.  “We’ve seen tons of CEOs and analysts try to shoehorn AI into their bullish narratives. And that’s going on for awhile now, and it worked,” Cramer said. “But I think those days will soon be numbered, unless they’ve got a legitimate way to make lots of money off AI, rather than [be] the equivalent of watching a goat surf, admittedly with great form, off the coast of Hawaii.”  Cramer said he doesn’t doubt that AI is going to have a huge impact, and will be a huge factor in the success of many companies, especially those that deal with large amounts of data.  But he questioned companies advertising AI directly to the consumer, cautioning investors that many may be hyping AI to raise their stock’s valuation. Some companies may be running out of “legitimate use cases” when it comes to AI. According to Cramer, AI is intended to save businesses money, not serve individual consumers.  “Unless there’s a return on investment that’s tangible and visible, generative AI may not be all that valuable,” he said. “I’m beginning to believe that a lot of companies have embraced AI for show. And if they can’t deliver a real return, the hype will peak and the whole notion of AI as a transformative business to consumer, to consumer, will fizzle. So, the stocks of companies that pushed that story will fizzle with them.”

In parallel, artificial intelligence approaches such as machine learning have led to exciting developments in the computational drug design field, facilitating biological activity prediction and de novo drug design for molecular targets of interest. Here, we describe current and future synergies between these developments to effectively identify drug candidates from the plethora of molecules produced by nature. We also discuss how to address key challenges in realizing the potential of these synergies, such as the need for high-quality datasets to train deep learning algorithms and appropriate strategies for algorithm validation.  Introduction Bacteria, fungi, plants and animals produce a wide range of specialized metabolites, also known as natural products. Across the tree of life, these comprise hundreds of thousands of different chemical structures — including peptides, polyketides, saccharides, terpenes and alkaloids — that facilitate an organism’s ability to thrive in a particular environment. They have crucial roles in complex inter-organismal interactions, functioning as signals, weapons, nutrient-scavenging agents and stress protectants to mediate competition and collaboration. In the host–microbiome context, specialized metabolites mediate competition and collaboration between microbes and their host.  These natural products have historically been applied with remarkable success as antibiotics, chemotherapeutics, immunosuppressants and crop protection agents. Natural products remain a promising source for the discovery of such drugs based on characteristics such as their relatively high degree of three-dimensionality (as opposed to the often ‘flat’ synthetic structures), which may be important in modulating challenging drug targets, and their origins as natural metabolites, which makes them likely to be substrates for transporter systems that can enable drugs to reach their targets1,2.  Although the popularity of natural product discovery programmes in the pharmaceutical industry diminished between roughly 1990 and 2010 owing to the rise of combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening3, there has been a recent renaissance in natural products research in both academia and small biotech start-ups. This renaissance is catalysed by the availability of large-scale omics data, which allows deeper access to the hidden chemical treasure troves of the biosphere. The genes for most specialized metabolite biosynthetic pathways in bacteria and fungi (and some in plants and animals) appear as clusters in the genome of the producing organisms: more than 2,500 of these biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and their products have now been characterized experimentally4. This physical clustering has the potential to facilitate the identification of millions of putative biosynthetic pathways for novel molecules through computational genomic analysis5, which could provide starting points for drug discovery.  In the field studying natural products, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are now being developed to predict (parts of) chemical structures of BGC products based on DNA sequence alone, fuelled by data on known biosynthetic pathways and their chemical products, which is increasingly standardized and stored in public databases. Although this helps in identifying molecules with new rather than known chemical structures (dereplication) and in linking molecules to their biosynthetic genes6, there is an urgent need for more effective ways to filter and prioritize the enormous predicted natural product biosynthetic diversity to identify drug leads.  In the field of computational drug design, AI strategies are being developed that may help to address this challenge by providing better understanding of structure–activity relationships and by predicting macromolecular targets for natural products based on their chemical structures. Here, two main approaches are traditionally used: on the one hand, statistical modelling focuses on finding correlations between chemical structure and biological activity, termed quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) modelling; on the other hand, structure-based research attempts to fit 3D chemical structures to protein targets (docking) and subsequently study their behaviour on the nano- to millisecond timescale (molecular dynamics).  For both fields, AI methods have opened up new possibilities in the design, synthesis and biological profiling of existing and new small molecules. Central to these methods are public databases that provide biological activity data for large numbers of (protein) targets and chemical structures. On the basis of chemical similarity, advanced machine learning techniques can use these data to obtain models that are able to predict the potential activity of untested chemical structures within these extensive chemical collections. Moreover, these methods can also be used to systematically analyse large datasets routinely produced from extended molecular dynamics studies and identify hidden patterns in the protein dynamics7,8. This has led to exciting successes that have advanced the understanding of the complex interplay between small molecules and protein macromolecules. Examples include new computer-suggested chemical structures (de novo design)9, drug repurposing through the prediction of unexpected activities and guiding medicinal chemistry approaches to modify and optimize drug molecules for their biological effects (both on and off target)10.  There is thus great potential for cross-fertilization between the fields of omics-based natural product discovery and computational drug design (Fig. 1). The use of AI could lead to a rapid acceleration of scientific progress in these fields and to a convergence of their methods and directions. For example, scientists have started to apply machine learning — a subfield of AI that generates insights by using algorithms to recognize patterns from data — to the discovery and structural characterization of natural products and to predict relationships between structure and pharmaceutical properties.  Fig. 1: Applications of artificial intelligence in natural product and drug discovery. figure 1 Classical analyses typically use only a small fraction of datasets of various types, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, structural data and bioactivity data. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods can help to integrate different data types to learn complex feature relationships and develop meaningful hypotheses. AI methods that can have a key role in natural product drug discovery include, but are not limited to: non-machine learning methods (part a) such as correlation and regression (for example, linking metabolomic and genomic data190); traditional machine learning methods (part b), such as self-organizing maps (SOMs) (for example, for macromolecular target prediction221) and clustering (for example, grouping gene cluster families222); and deep learning (part c), such as convolutional neural networks (for example, for chemical structure elucidation47), computer vision (for example, automatic chemical image recognition166) and natural language processing (for example, topic modelling for chemical substructure exploration and annotation223).  Full size image However, researchers in these fields have interacted very little so far. In this Review, we present an integrated perspective of a group of scientists from both areas based on an interactive workshop that discussed new ways to connect these research areas and jointly leverage the power of AI to use the vast chemical diversity of the biosphere for the development of new drugs. We first describe applications of AI in natural product research, including genome and metabolome mining, structural characterization of natural products and prediction of the targets and biological activities of natural products. We then discuss a key challenge in realizing the potential of AI in the field — the creation and maintenance of large, high-quality datasets with which to train algorithms — and how this could be addressed. We also consider the pitfalls in training algorithms, such as overfitting, and approaches to avoid them (Box 1).  Box 1 Standard practices for evaluating a machine learning model ‘Garbage in, garbage out’ is a well-known concept in machine learning that is intuitive to understand, but without proper model validation it can be challenging to identify the true predictive power of a model. There are two key points to keep in mind when assessing a model: data balancing and model evaluation on an independent test set.  Data balancing  Datasets that are used for machine learning are usually not homogeneous. Imbalance can exist in multiple ways that lead to incorrect model evaluation.  Over-representation of one or more data labels. Consider a binary classification problem for drug–target interaction with a dataset of 10,000 positive and 100 negative data points. Without addressing this imbalance before training, the model will likely always predict an interaction between drug and target regardless of the input. The model will be correct 99% of the time even though it has no predictive power.  Over-representation of one or more data features. This is a very common imbalance in biological data: some species and molecule types have been researched far more extensively than others, leading to datasets with an over-representation of certain sequences or molecular structures. Models trained on such data without consideration for this type of imbalance usually seem to perform very well, as they make good predictions for sequences or molecules from over-represented phylogenetic branches or compound classes. Poor predictions on under-represented clades often go unnoticed: either the few mispredictions in the independent test set form such a small proportion of the total tested data points that they do not affect the average performance much; or worse, the under-represented clades do not appear in the test set at all.  These data imbalances have to be targeted at three stages of model development.  Data selection for training and test sets before model training. For each type of data label and data feature, data points should first be filtered for duplicates or near-duplicates and subsequently be divided proportionally across training and test sets. For sequence data, pre-filtering could mean selecting one representative of a phylogenetic clade and excluding the rest; for compound data, one could cluster based on chemical similarity and include only one member for each cluster. This avoids (near)-duplicates in training and test sets that would yield an automatic correct prediction. Proportional division of the resulting data points across training and test sets based on class and feature labels (for example, 80% training and 20% test for each label) ensures that the model can be separately evaluated on each data subclass, resulting in more accurate model evaluation.  Sampling and data weighting during model training. When a model is not instructed otherwise, it will prioritize overall accuracy. Often, this means that the model tolerates mispredictions for under-represented data classes. To prevent this, data can be weighted during model training: under-represented classes should receive higher weights or contribute more towards a model’s loss function such that the model penalizes prediction errors for those classes more than prediction errors for over-represented classes. Alternatively, it is possible to undersample or oversample the dataset to artificially reduce or expand the dataset such that each data class is proportionally represented. Both approaches result in models that should be more generally applicable and less biased towards over-represented data labels or features.  Class-specific model evaluation after model training. To evaluate how the model performs for each data subclass, regardless of how many data points belong to that class, it is important to assess predictive power for each class separately. This can be done for data labels with true or false positive or negative rates, and for data features by assessing performance for each sequence or compound cluster.  Cross-validation and independent test sets  Usually, machine learning algorithms are not trained just once: developers have to play around with input features, model parameters and model types before they find a model that works. A frequent inaccuracy in this process is that the same test set is often used for evaluation of these in-between models and for the evaluation of the final model. At this point, the test set is no longer truly independent, as decisions that influence model performance have been made based on the test set. Thus, overfitting of the model may remain unnoticed this way. Therefore, it is crucial to hold out an independent test set before any training and only use this test set to assess the model’s performance at the very end of development. Monitoring model performance during development can be done by selecting a validation set from training data or by doing cross-validation with all training data. Optimally, multiple runs should be performed with a representative standard deviation to be able to statistically test observed improvements for significance. When selecting (cross-)validation sets, it is equally important to take into account data imbalance.  Show more Uses of AI in natural product research Natural product genome and metabolome mining Several AI technologies have been developed to accelerate the discovery of natural products by predicting biosynthetic genes and metabolite structures from sequence or spectral data, respectively. Identifying natural product BGCs still largely relies on rule-based methods such as those used in antiSMASH11 and PRISM12. Although these approaches are successful at detecting known BGC classes, they are less proficient at identifying novel types of BGC or unclustered pathways13,14. In these more complex cases, machine learning algorithms have been shown to offer significant advantages over rule-based methods. For example, the hidden Markov model-based method ClusterFinder15, the deep learning approaches DeepBGC16, GECCO17 and SanntiS18, and several genome mining algorithms for ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs)19,20,21,22 each use deep learning or support vector machines to identify BGCs not captured using canonical rule-based annotation approaches. These methods were trained on sequence-based features such as gene families, protein domains and amino acid sequence properties. Although they still have a higher false positive rate than rule-based approaches and also suffer from false negatives for known types of BGC, they have already demonstrated utility in identifying novel classes of natural product biosynthetic pathways13. For example, the decRiPPter algorithm, aimed to predict novel RiPP families, identified pristinin, which belongs to a novel class of lanthipeptides19 (Fig. 2). In addition, DeepRiPP, thanks to its deep learning-based RiPP precursor detection module, enabled the discovery of the RiPPs deepflavo and deepginsen, whose precursor peptides were encoded distantly from any of their associated biosynthetic enzymes21.  Fig. 2: Example compounds discovered using artificial intelligence approaches. figure 2 The synthetic compound halicin and related molecules were discovered using a deep neural network trained to predict antibiotic activity from chemical structure64. The structures of the rivulariapeptolides and symplocolide A were predicted from complex microbial extracts using a convolutional neural network28,152. Pristinin A3 was discovered using a support vector machine that mines pangenomes to prioritize novel ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) precursors within operon-like structures in the accessory genome of a genus19. Deepflavo and deepginsen were discovered in part using natural language processing to predict their RiPP precursors and their cleavage patterns from genomes21.  Full size image Whereas genome mining algorithms can hint at biosynthetic potential, metabolomics allows direct detection of biosynthesized components, even if their precise structures are unknown. However, inferring molecular structures and substructures from mass spectrometry (MS) data is far from straightforward. Therefore, AI has been leveraged to target common challenges in MS-based metabolome mining23, including library matching and searching using mass spectral similarity metrics24,25, molecular formula annotation26,27, molecular class annotation28,29 and retention time prediction30. The efficacy of these algorithms is still limited by the relatively small sets of tandem MS (MS/MS) spectra annotated with the fragment ion chemical structures of their corresponding metabolites. However, these algorithms can be enhanced by imputing missing data; for example, by predicting molecular fingerprints or simulated spectra from metabolite structures directly28. Similarly, NMR metabolome mining tasks are undergoing transformation31, as deep learning provides new avenues towards improving NMR spectrum reconstruction, denoising32, peak picking, J-coupling prediction33 and spectral deconvolution34.  Ultimately, AI algorithms that link genome-mined BGCs and gene cluster families to untargeted metabolome-mined spectra and predicted molecular classes should be developed. For example, a new deep learning algorithm was recently published that can predict biosynthetic routes from natural product chemical structures, which could provide a basis for matching with BGCs35. Such algorithms will help to de-orphan BGCs and molecular structures to address the large annotation gap between genomics and metabolomics. This may allow the combination of sequence and metabolome data to predict metabolite structures synergistically.  Structural characterization of natural products Successful natural product drug discovery studies require the ability to unambiguously solve the structures of isolated compounds36. This task is challenging owing to the chemical complexity of metabolites existing in nature. Structure elucidation requires the collection, analysis and compilation of multiple data types, which may include NMR, infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV), electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and X-ray spectroscopy, high-resolution MS (HRMS), MS/MS, and experimental and/or computational inspection of the encoded enzymes within the producing BGC37,38. Recently, the microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) technique, which has the potential to accelerate structure elucidation by allowing analysis of submicron-sized crystals of chemical compounds, was added to this arsenal39,40.  In general, significant efforts have been made to improve the structural characterization of natural products through methodological, instrumentational and computational means, such as quantum chemistry-based theoretical calculations and AI-based structure predictions from MS and NMR data. Since as early as 1960, AI has been used to complement rule-based approaches in de novo identification of unknown compounds from MS data41,42. Subsequently, AI has been used to predict molecular formulae from MS spectra43, match MS spectra to compounds in molecular databases using deep neural networks41,43, elucidate structures de novo as SMILES strings from MS/MS spectra44 and predict chemical properties and identify small molecules from MS1 and collisional cross section (CCS) data45.  Similarly, AI has been used to augment NMR-based structure elucidation and annotation. Computer-assisted structure elucidation (CASE) programs46 reduce erroneous structural assignments by generating a probability-based ranking of all possible structures given an NMR dataset, which can guide structure determination. Examples include the convolutional neural network-based tool SMART 2.0, which guided the discovery and structure elucidation of a novel class of natural products including the new macrolide symplocolide A47, SMART-Miner48 and COLMAR49, which identify and annotate primary metabolites from the NMR spectra of complex mixtures, and DP4-AI, which combines quantum chemistry-based theoretical calculations of NMR shifts with a Bayesian approach that assigns correctness probabilities to candidate structures, and with objective model selection for picking peaks and reducing noise50,51. One drawback of quantum chemistry-based theoretical calculations of NMR shifts lies in the need for extensive exploration of a metabolite’s conformational space, which is computationally demanding for conformationally flexible molecules. Machine learning models such as ASE-ANI52 have been developed to address this issue by filtering force field-generated conformations and thus reducing the computational cost.  Predicting targets and biological activity One of the most important application areas for AI in natural product drug discovery is prediction of the macromolecular targets of the natural products, their associated biological activities and possible toxicities. Accurate predictions of these characteristics will provide direct clues as to which areas of chemical space (Box 2) are most promising for drug discovery. This will be key to the potential success of genome mining, which currently results in lists of candidate BGCs that are too large, with few strategies available to target efforts towards parts of natural product space (Box 2) with actual pharmaceutical potential. AI techniques, in combination with other technologies, can help to address this challenge (Fig. 3).  Fig. 3: Predicting biological activities and macromolecular targets from genomic, metabolomic and phenotypic data. figure 3 Omics datasets can be mined to identify genetic features of natural product biosynthetic pathways, such as resistance genes, transporters and links with primary metabolism, which are predictive of the biological activity or macromolecular target of the products of the pathway. Metabolomics and NMR (in concert with analysis of biosynthetic genes) can be used to identify chemical features of metabolites that are predictive of certain activities or targets. Finally, large-scale standardized phenotypic bioassays are key. There is considerable potential for artificial intelligence approaches to then predict targets and activities based on combined sets of genetic and chemical features of natural products and their biosynthetic pathways. BGC, biosynthetic gene cluster.  Full size image Box 2 Visualizing and navigating chemical space Chemical space — typically defined by using multiple compound properties of interest, such as physicochemical properties — is vast and largely unexplored224. Just ‘drug-like’ chemical space, composed of all compounds that comply with Lipinski’s ‘rule-of-five’ guidelines for oral bioavailability225, has been estimated to encompass ~1060 compounds, and even the largest chemical libraries used for computational screening usually encompass only ~1010 compounds. Importantly for the context of this article, however, the study that underlies Lipinski’s rule225 identified natural products as common exceptions, and the chemical features of natural products and typical compounds in the screening libraries of pharmaceutical companies differ. These library compounds are often planar, synthetic small molecules that comply with Lipinski’s rules, with mass <500 Da, whereas natural products typically have greater size and 3D complexity.  Exploring chemical space is a daunting task, not only because of the sheer quantity of compounds that can be (virtually) enumerated, but also because the description and labelling of compounds is by definition a multidimensional problem. For visualization purposes, a high-dimensional space will be reduced to only two or three dimensions. Also, depending on the properties of interest, the chemical space to be explored will be constructed differently. Still, given that most of chemical space is unexplored, taking the challenge of solving the multiparameter optimization problem to navigate chemical space is considered a promising strategy for identifying novel drug candidates226,227,228.  A common way to reduce dimensionalities to navigate chemical space is via principal component analysis (PCA). PCA of chemical properties has revealed that both drug molecules and natural products occupy a very similar topological diversity distribution, which was not the case for combinatorial compounds229. Another method is t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE), which has been used successfully for the design of new drug classes, for example, new kinase inhibitors226. A recent development to t-SNE is the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm, which is less computationally expensive than the previous approach and can therefore be applied to larger datasets227. More recently, a Tree MAP (TMAP) algorithm was developed to visualize data sets with sample sizes up to around 107 in a tree layout228. In this article, using TMAP, a tree of all the compounds in the ChEMBL database (1.13 million) with their associated biological assay data was constructed within 10 min.  The application of unsupervised learning approaches (such as PCA, t-SNE, UMAP and TMAP) to reduce dimensionalities in chemical space data can be used to infer the likely biological activity of compounds and ultimately identify new scaffolds. This approach has proved successful in the small-molecule discovery field, and we believe its application to natural products will open up new avenues to characterize and address, among others, biological activity and pharmacokinetic properties. It would be exciting to implement the newly developed dimensionality reduction tools, with their improved computational capabilities, in mapping both natural product and small molecules, to identify overlapping chemical space and ultimately transfer knowledge between the two fields.  A starting point could be the merging of the large Papyrus database on drug-like molecules with existing natural product databases230. Molecular standardization of Papyrus could be applied to the natural product databases to determine whether additional rules or procedures are required. The resulting database could be used as a dataset to apply existing visualization and dimensionality reduction methods. A subsequent challenge is that the application of these methods should be validated using known synthetic molecules and natural products.  Show more Natural product target elucidation The progress of novel natural products towards being selected as drug candidates is often hampered by lack of knowledge about their targets, which impedes their preclinical testing and rational optimization. Given the complexity of metabolite isolation and handling, large-scale experimental determination of mechanisms of action for these molecules is not feasible owing to the costs and effort required. Computational models that rapidly predict the most likely targets from the molecular structure are therefore an area of active research53. Virtually all computational drug discovery approaches have been successfully applied to elucidate targets of natural products, including docking54, clustering55, bioactivity fingerprints56, pharmacophores57 and machine learning58. In some cases, this has also led to new insights regarding the mechanisms of action of natural products that were already in clinical trials59. Although applicability is currently limited, given this success and the increasing accuracy of advanced machine learning models, we expect further developments in this area that will lead to tailored and further improved models.  Classical cheminformatics- and pharmacophore-based predictions of bioactivity Methods that rely on the use of classical cheminformatics and computer-assisted drug discovery tools to predict bioactivities for natural products are plentiful53. For example, the direct application of the ensemble-based popular prediction methods PASS60 and SEA61 to natural products have shown some successes. Given the distinct chemical structures and physicochemical properties of natural products55,62, the most successful applications use additional preprocessing steps or rely on chemical descriptions and representations that are agnostic to the chemical differences between natural products and the training data of synthetic compounds. For example, the SPiDER method, based on self-organizing maps, was specifically developed to predict the bioactivities of molecules and has been successfully applied to predict the biological activity of macrocyclic natural products55,62 and fragment-like natural products57.  Other successful applications of bioactivity predictions have used representations such as 3D pharmacophore matching57 of bioactivity signatures coupled to deep neural networks63,64. A notable approach consists of constructing learned representations using the deep learning-based chemprop message-passing neural network65. Such models capture essential properties of molecules without directly using classic chemical fingerprints and have enabled the prediction of the bactericidal activity of the synthetic chemical compounds halicin64 and abaucin66, as well as eight additional molecules with antibiotic properties structurally distinct from known antibiotic classes64 (Fig. 2).  Molecular dynamics simulations and structure-based prediction of bioactivity Structure-based approaches use spatial information about a protein target to predict a compound’s binding mode. This information can be obtained from experimentally determined structures (for example, with X-ray crystallography) or via deep learning-based modelling approaches such as AlphaFold67. Then, potential binding modes can be enumerated via strategies such as molecular docking with protein dynamics accounted for via molecular dynamics approaches. These methods are computationally expensive, but have been taking advantage of both hardware (graphics processing unit (GPU) computing) and software improvements68. Structure-based methods can provide a wealth of information; for example, the applicability and use of the free-energy perturbation (FEP) method has recently increased substantially in academic and industrial drug discovery projects69. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics and FEP could be extended to study affinities of natural products.  Sequence- or BGC-based predictions of bioactivity A growing number of approaches have been used to predict bioactivities based on DNA and/or protein sequence data from BGCs with machine learning12,70,71, and other strategies have the potential to do so in the near future.  One approach that leverages knowledge of existing small molecules is to predict the final product of a BGC and infer its activity from this prediction directly, as exemplified by PRISM12. One issue with this method is the challenge faced in predicting activities for BGCs with poorly predicted structures, where even small mistakes in the final prediction could yield vastly different activities for the real compound. As substructure prediction is more robust, use of discrete substructural features such as β-lactam rings or specific amino acids may produce more accurate results for a broader range of BGCs.  Alternative approaches emerging for bioactivity prediction draw on the field of natural language processing (NLP). NLP-based methods such as word2vec72, originally developed for context-aware embedding of words within sentences in text documents, have been extended to embed protein domains within BGCs using pfam2vec16. DeepBGC, a de novo BGC prediction tool16, represents predicted BGCs using pfam2vec-derived features from protein domains; these features are then supplied to a random forest classifier to predict natural product activity. Building on the DeepBGC framework, Deep-BGCpred implements dual-model serial screening and a ‘sliding window’ strategy for more accurate BGC boundary detection71. Just as NLP has revolutionized other fields, we expect continued, rapid advances in applications of NLP for BGC and bioactivity prediction.  Of note, the sequence boundaries for BGCs predicted by mining tools are not precise, often missing portions of the BGC or fusing them with others. To use BGC sequence data as input for machine learning, it is generally necessary for an expert to manually update the BGC boundaries. Improvements in BGC prediction will therefore be vital for such bioactivity prediction methods and remain an area where further research is needed.  Bioactivity predictions based on self-resistance, regulatory or evolutionary features Bacteria have long been known to harbour resistance genes that enable them to withstand the effects of antibiotic natural products that they themselves produce73. Numerous antimicrobial resistance determinant databases are available, such as the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD)74, a National Database of Antibiotic Resistant Organisms (NDARO) and ResFinder75. To leverage resistance information, various algorithms have been created to attempt to link these resistance genes with BGCs, as the resistance genes are necessary to confer immunity in the host76,77. A recent study incorporated both general protein domains and resistance genes to create a more robust feature set; this method proved accurate when sufficient training data were available, such as for antibacterial prediction in bacterial BGCs70.  As an additional layer of biological information, transcription factor networks and their cognate regulatory elements can be used to classify BGCs on the basis of how they are controlled and to which (environmental) signals they respond. The EvoMining framework78 is based on the concept that streptomycetes adapt to their ecological niche by evolving their primary and secondary metabolism in response to their environment79. Regulatory networks that control BGCs and the cognate signals that unlock their biosynthesis may provide key information on the function of the natural products they specify. Regulatory networks have so far been largely ignored in genome mining approaches but may well be a key determinant for biological understanding and function prediction. Whereas BGCs predict what types of metabolite may be produced, regulatory networks can be harnessed to estimate how BGCs are controlled and — notably — in response to which signals. This information may serve as a beacon to find BGCs or metabolites required for specific purposes, such as responses to stress or disease. This could, for example, be used to predict which gene clusters are expressed in mutualist microbes in response to pathogen invasion, which may help to prioritize BGCs for antibiotic discovery.  Emerging AI methods in natural product drug discovery In all of the application areas mentioned above, AI technology is still in its infancy and suffers from a lack of (high-quality) standardized data. However, refined approaches for building machine learning models using sparse or variable training set data are being developed, and new (often community-driven) initiatives to curate or generate high-quality datasets are starting to emerge. Together, these advances suggest that major improvements in AI methodological accuracy are within reach. Below, we discuss algorithmic developments that could have a significant impact and then consider data generation and standardization challenges that will need to be addressed to exploit the full potential of these algorithms.  Molecular featurization methods Complex molecular data are made machine readable through featurization, and the extent to which the most important information in a dataset can be captured concisely is crucial for the success of machine learning algorithms (Fig. 4). Simplification is inherent to featurization. In rare cases, this can lead to clashes whereby two or more molecules are represented by the same fingerprint. Hence, a featurization technique that aligns with the goal of the use should be carefully chosen.  Fig. 4: Chemical featurization techniques. figure 4 Numerous featurization technologies are available to encode chemical information in a manner that machine learning techniques can process. These technologies range from simple physicochemical properties, via commonly used circular fingerprints, to advanced 3D and neural net-based encoders. Use of an appropriate featurization method is key, as the interpretation of a machine learning model is based on the features on which this model is trained. Although possible, combinations of featurization techniques are not common.  Full size image The most ubiquitous method for featurizing a molecule is to convert its molecular structure into a sequence of bits or counts80. Algorithms to create such fingerprints are readily implemented in cheminformatic software packages such as RDKit (see Related links) and the Chemistry Development Kit81; however, molecule features can be manually determined as well82.  Circular fingerprints have enabled the most accurate identification of structurally related natural products83,84,85,86. However, circular fingerprints were found to be less useful than pharmacophore-based descriptors for scaffold hopping from natural products to synthetic mimetics87. Other recent examples are MAP4 fingerprints, which combine substructure and atom-pair concepts and can be used to distinguish bacterial from fungal natural products88,89. Also, features created from short molecular dynamics simulations can be used to accurately predict partition coefficients, solvation free energies or even ligand affinity90,91,92,93,94. Recent approaches to ‘k-merize’ 3D shapes95, which can be sampled from molecule conformers, may also provide promise for fingerprinting, as they may take into account the 3D shape of molecules. Conversely, compound features that do not describe the compound structure at all can also be helpful, as exemplified by bioactivity fingerprints63,96,97,98,99.  Deep learning A diverse array of AI algorithms have been developed over the past decade, many of which have been successfully applied to natural product research (Fig. 1). One machine learning technology that has recently received considerable attention and application is deep learning. Deep learning has the flexibility to capture nonlinear relationships and to accept non-tabular input that extends the applicability of AI for natural product computational research to non-Euclidean domains100,101. Deep learning for molecular function prediction on molecular graphs sometimes outperforms simpler machine learning models on circular fingerprints65, although this seems to vary between datasets and applications102,103. Furthermore, explainable AI methods have been shown to improve interpretability of such deep learning models104,105; for example, in the assessment of preclinical relevance106 and for pharmacophore and toxicophore identification107,108.  Applications of deep learning include molecular graph neural network approaches109,110,111,112; for instance, for predicting drug–target binding affinity113, SMILES-based approaches for de novo drug-like molecule generation114,115, graph-based de novo molecular generation116, and property prediction117,118 and surface mesh-based approaches for protein pocket-conditioned molecular representations119. Moreover, encoder–decoder architectures are used to featurize compounds for virtual screening from different input formats120,121,122. A comprehensive overview of deep learning molecular representations, which can be applied to molecular structure data in natural product research, is provided in ref. 123.  One of the most notable deep learning approaches of past years is AlphaFold67, which can predict the 3D structure of proteins from their primary amino acid sequence by learning from the entire corpus of the Protein Data Bank. Since the landmark breakthrough by AlphaFold, accurate modelling approaches building on this work continue to raise the bar124 by tackling challenges such as multimeric structure prediction125. For natural product research, structural prediction is highly relevant, as it can, for example, help to predict the substrate specificities across natural product biosynthetic enzyme families or help to predict the evolution of drug resistance by target modification. The precedent set by AlphaFold suggests that deep learning has the potential to solve long-standing problems in natural product computational research, although natural product data are currently much sparser.  As deep learning for natural product computational research is still in its infancy, caution should be applied to its predictions126,127. To build trust and use the full potential of deep learning, we believe a set of best practices needs to be established for using deep learning techniques in natural product research128,129.  Compare the performance of new deep learning models with simpler models to validate and motivate the trade-off between interpretability and prediction results130,131,132,133,134.  Clarify the scope in which the model optimally performs by defining its applicability domain and adding confidence estimates to predictions135,136.  Evaluate the model through cross-validation and use of a true hold-out set, avoiding a random splitting approach with a preference for chemical clustering or temporal splitting131, and, if applicable, including prospective experiments. Owing to the practice of publishing synthetic compounds as chemical analogues with a structure–activity relationship, random splitting for validation overestimates the ability of models to generalize. Therefore, chemical clustering or temporal splitting is essential to truly validate created models131.  Understand the results of a new model. If allowed by the chosen method, map what the algorithm learned back to input features and provide proper visualizations that allow interpretation of results for bench scientists106,108,137.  Deep learning algorithms will definitely not always be the most suitable tools138. Nonetheless, we do expect that they will become increasingly useful to address challenges such as structure elucidation and activity prediction as datasets in compatible formats grow.  Approaches to address data limitations One of the biggest challenges for deep learning in natural product research is open access to large curated datasets, which is discussed in the next section. ‘Data-hungry’ algorithms such as deep learning will only improve performance if training datasets are sufficient to support model complexity. One solution to reduce the number of effectively required data points is to use weights from pre-trained models on larger chemical datasets. Using pre-validated and pre-trained chemical models such as ChemBERTa139 or MoleculeNet102 reduces the computational load required to train new models from scratch. In many cases, pre-trained models will also yield higher prediction accuracies140.  Although deep learning techniques can overcome issues of incomplete sample labelling and small datasets, semi-supervised learning (combining labelled with unlabelled data) can assist with learning on datasets with incomplete labelling141,142. This has been applied in the past, for example, to improve substrate specificity predictions of natural product biosynthetic enzymes using transductive support vector machines, where this helped to map the shape of unlabelled sequence space to better know how queries would relate to labelled data points143. An alternative is transfer learning144, a strategy in which knowledge from a task learned on an extensive dataset can then be transferred to a related task for which fewer data are available. This can improve model efficiency and mitigate issues relating to low-data regimes145, for example, in de novo molecular design146,147,148.  Active learning techniques, which guide the selection of unlabelled data for labelling through experimentation, can also be deployed when labelled training data are limited149. This has been successfully applied to identify small molecules that inhibit the protein–protein interaction between the anticancer target CXC chemokine receptor 4 and its ligand by actively retrieving informative active compounds that continuously improved the adaptive structure–activity model150. Multiple practical challenges remain before active learning can be broadly deployed149, many of which revolve around the time requirements and cost of standardized experimental data acquisition. This might explain why active learning has not yet been broadly deployed in natural product research, where experiments are commonly complex. For example, CANOPUS28, a deep neural network-based structure class annotation tool that is based on MS spectra, uses other AI tools including ClassyFire151 and NPClassifier29 to label data and thus train the network. This enabled the structural elucidation of the novel rivulariapeptolide protease inhibitors from complex mixtures28,152. With increasing experimental resolution and automation, we believe that active learning will play a central part in future natural product research.  Similarly, reinforcement learning, which steers the output of a machine learning algorithm towards user-defined regions of optimality via a predefined (computational) reward function, has shown promise in de novo design towards attractive regions of chemical space153,154,155, for rule-based organic chemistry and for retrosynthesis prediction156,157,158,159.  Data sources and data standardization High-quality training datasets are crucial to the success of AI algorithms. Unstructured datasets (for example, unannotated MS data) can be used for unsupervised learning applications such as dimensionality reduction and bioactivity prediction. By contrast, supervised learning requires training data that are both accurately annotated and of sufficient scope to answer the question being addressed. This is a particular challenge for natural products applications in which the breadth of chemical space is high but the coverage of most published datasets is low. Data augmentation and synthetic data generation, although valuable techniques, should be carried out with care to avoid the accumulation of bias. In addition, data error is a challenge in the field. Heterogeneous biological public data generated in many labs tends to provide multiple sources of error that can hamper highly sensitive deep learning methods160,161. Integrating data from different datasets and ensuring that annotation methods are consistent is therefore a major bottleneck for the development of training sets for machine learning. In this section, we explore the characteristics and attributes necessary to create high-quality datasets to advance natural product discovery, including discussion of the current state of natural product databases (Table 1) and data dissemination, the need for data standardization, annotation and integration and the creation of training sets.  Table 1 Databases for natural product data Full size table The natural product database landscape The landscape of natural product databases is large and diverse, but is also highly fragmented, and it currently contains few comprehensive and well-curated data resources162. Unfortunately, natural product-related data are often under-represented or not annotated as natural products in large generalist databases (such as PubChem, ChEMBL, Reaxys and Scifinder); for example, as of January 2023, only 8,951 natural products have a ChEMBL identifier according to Wikidata (see Related links). Additionally, documentation of data sources, acquisition and changes — known as data provenance — is not well maintained in most natural product databases. For example, literature citations or information on source organisms and associated BGCs may be missing. Furthermore, although some databases (such as ChEMBL163 and BindingDB164) include bioassay data for pure compounds, very few include bioassay data for natural product extracts and fractions. Finally, some natural product databases lack options for full data download, or are not licensed for open use by academic groups. Together, these issues severely limit the availability of amenable datasets to train AI models.  Challenges with natural product data dissemination Literature curation Scientific publication remains the dominant mechanism for disseminating new natural product information. Unfortunately, automated data extraction from natural product journals is often impossible because data are not in machine-readable formats, despite the existence of simple solutions such as compact identifiers165. Database completeness is also hampered by the broad spectrum of journals that feature natural product research, including many journals that are not natural products specific.  Consequently, database developers must manually curate articles to convert them into structured data formats. Curation difficulties include image-to-structure conversion, absence of core data (for example, BGC sequence), resolution of name conflicts (multiple structures with the same name, or structures with multiple names) and extraction of data and metadata for biological assays. Improvements are underway for structure recognition from images using DECIMER 1.0 (refs. 166,167) and through new formats for reporting of chemical structure data168. Nevertheless, high-quality digitization of research data into structured open formats remains an unsolved challenge. This is further complicated by the byzantine and overly restrictive copyright rules that currently govern journal articles. Finally, because most natural product databases focus on only one feature of natural product data, there is presently high redundancy in curation efforts, as the existence of minor variations in the extracted data (for example, structure standardization methods or character encodings for compound names) may interfere with linking records between databases.  One solution to this issue would be to encourage authors to include a standardized machine-readable file for each compound described in the paper, similar to the cif file required for each X-ray structure. This machine-readable file could contain crucial information about each structure (for example, SMILES, compound name, availability and location of spectral data, source organism and BGC) and would offer a central point of reference for data dissemination and automated database importation by natural product-centric resources.  Data deposition Several of the larger natural product data repositories, including Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG)169, the Natural Products Atlas (NP Atlas)170,171, Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking (GNPS)172, Natural Products Magnetic Resonance Database (NP-MRD)173 and Norine174 offer mechanisms to accept user-deposited data (Fig. 5). However, without clear incentives to deposit data, deposition rates are low. In addition, managing the infrastructure for data depositions (interactive web page construction, database version control, authentication management and database security) and curating and correcting errors is complicated and time consuming, and often beyond the capacity of academic database developers.  Fig. 5: Depositing and sharing natural product data: infrastructure and incentives. figure 5 Diverse types of data on the structures, biological activities and biosynthetic pathways of natural products can be deposited into dedicated community databases, allowing their reuse as well as providing training data for artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. As standardized deposition of such data will be crucial for the future of AI-driven natural product drug discovery, it will be important to provide the scientific community with clear incentives and rewards to submit and share their data. This includes opportunities for collaboration, online (comparative) analysis capabilities linked to these databases, community-driven annotation and knowledge build-up and increasing impact through follow-up work and the citations that result from this. GNPS, Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking; NP Atlas, Natural Products Atlas; NP-MRD, Natural Products Magnetic Resonance Database.  Full size image The extensive and often manual data entry requirements for journal article submission lead to ‘deposition fatigue’ for authors. The varied natural product-related data types (such as source organisms, MS, NMR, BGC and SMILES) amplify this, and increase the number of platforms that users must navigate to deposit raw data in open repositories. The community must therefore develop mechanisms to streamline, incentivize and reward data and metadata deposition, such as with the development of a centralized venue for pre-publication data deposition that can disseminate these data to speciality databases (Fig. 5).  Two principal avenues exist to incentivize data deposition to public repositories: ‘value added’ and ‘requirements’. First, authorships during data ‘curatathons’, increased citations, opportunities for collaboration and facilitated automated re-analysis are very beneficial for depositors175. An example of added value is ReDU, which aids in rapid re-analysis of existing and future data176 through subscription to one’s own and public datasets172. Alternatively, repositories can offer validation reports, quality metrics, prevalence statistics (for example, the statistics page of MIBiG4 that facilitates cross-species comparisons of biosynthetic potential) and other feedback on data to depositors that provides a tangible and immediate benefit to deposition. We acknowledge that, at present, data deposition is usually a long process that requires submitters to fill in as much metadata as possible following ontologies or controlled vocabularies. These extended processes should become more user friendly; for example, by including an autofill during metadata reporting, using tools that automatically generate entries from well-defined ontologies and automated emails to authors with filtered web-crawled data that authors can complete and send into relevant repositories.  Second, journals and/or funding agencies can mandate data deposition, eliminating the need for incentives. An excellent example of this is a recent announcement that the Journal of Natural Products requires the deposition of raw NMR data starting in July 2023 (ref. 177). Regardless of the motivation, promoting community-driven data deposition is indispensable to making the natural products field AI compatible.  The need for data standardization The foundation of high-quality datasets begins with experimental design and practice, the key being consistency. Currently, the most extensive, high-quality natural product-related datasets in the public domain have been generated by a few laboratories. Typically, however, the value of these datasets is limited owing to the lack of sample diversity and the limited number of data types available for a single study. Furthermore, even if appropriate controls and replication are used, there can be fundamental differences in the quality and quantity of detected features for the same sample set, as demonstrated for intra-laboratory liquid chromatography (LC)–MS/MS analyses178. As a result, a global assemblage of data would be incredibly valuable; yet challenges exist of poor interoperability (that is, connecting data between resources) and weak compatibility (that is, resources use different standards and ontologies to annotate and identify their contents).  It is important to note that the quality of biologically derived data (for example, MS resolution and/or accuracy, gene-sequencing depth and/or error rate) should be defined in light of the desired outcome. The metabolomics field, for example, has initiated the Metabolomics Standards Initiative179, which describes key parameters to report to facilitate quality assessment. Often, AI tasks rely on having a large corpus of data to train and/or search (for example, clustering MS/MS spectra180 and binning metagenomes181). One challenge with this requirement is that experimental datasets may contain only a single or very few representatives in each class, limiting their value for model building. Dedicating the effort to creating comprehensive training sets is an essential step for the field as it looks to embrace AI technologies.  To achieve standardization, a key focus must be the interoperability between existing natural product databases. At present, most database managers communicate updates on an ad hoc basis. In addition, some databases such as NP Atlas maintain interoperable application programming interfaces (APIs) to enable regular, automatic data crawls between resources. However, this becomes exceedingly complex if databases operate in a continuously updating fashion, mainly if resources use varied data standardization strategies, such as PubChem versus ChEMBL structure standardization protocols.  Besides specific, persistent identifiers, data interoperability requires common languages (that is, controlled vocabulary). Open standards have an essential role here, defining exchange formats, vocabularies and ontologies, and experimental protocols. For example, they could facilitate accurate description and reporting of the structural characterization of natural products182. Furthermore, the adoption of universal spectrum identifiers (USIs) to identify mass spectra in proteomics183 and metabolomics184 showcases standardization tools, enabling data analysis across datasets. Such tools have a pivotal role in enabling large-scale studies by structuring omics data and represent an area of development that the natural product community should consider. The implementation of semantic web approaches is also an essential step forwards, which standardizes how we disseminate knowledge and data and integrate exchange formats, linking between resources and ontological representation185. An overview of current natural product ontologies is provided in Table 2.  Table 2 Recommended ontologies and controlled vocabularies for natural product research Full size table The need for standardization in describing bioactivities of natural products and ensuring that experimental conditions are comparable between laboratories is apparent. Although standards exist for reporting the biological activities of purified compounds (for example, ChEMBL163, PubChem186, Supernatural II187 and NPASS188), such standardization does not extend to microbial crude extracts and fractions. In addition, metadata such as extract preparation methods can substantially impact bioactivity data, yet they are rarely recorded in natural product databases. Finally, as further discussed below, experimental conditions must be described as accurately as possible, with scientists preferably using the same growth conditions for their experiments. Overall, although it is clear that the move towards FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) data and metadata is happening in natural product research, many depositions still fail to include all required components.  The need for data annotation In addition to essential metadata (such as sample taxonomy, extract preparation protocol and instrument parameters), the addition of contextual annotations can greatly increase the value of natural product datasets. For example, accurate annotation of compound structures to metabolomics datasets would provide many opportunities to build machine learning models that integrate structural and biological and/or genomic data.  However, creation of annotated datasets faces two significant hurdles. The first is that most datasets can be annotated in many different ways, making it unrealistic to aggregate annotations from different studies into a single monolithic training set. Secondly, most annotation methods include elements of bias and false assignment that will influence model structure and accuracy. Therefore, although dataset annotation by subject experts is very valuable for AI developers, the creation and adoption of annotation standards for core information types should be seen as a priority for the field.  The need for data integration The value of linked or paired data As omics technologies mature, there is an increasing need for data integration between platforms. This is relevant to the development of AI models because some questions can be answered only by considering data from multiple data types. For example, large-scale integration of NMR spectra and MS fragmentation data could dramatically affect the accuracy and coverage of automated compound identification platforms.  Integration of natural product data involves two core activities: the pairing of datasets for analysis, such as that of the paired omics data platform, or the linking of raw or processed data across data types, such as the peptidogenomics, glycogenomics, metabologenomics or NPLinker platforms189,190,191,192,193,194,195,196. In the first case, the objective is to define which data types exist for each sample, whereas in the second case, the goal is to perform paired analyses whereby both data types are mined at the same time197. An example of this combined data approach is the integration of enzyme-constrained models and omics analysis of Streptomyces coelicolor to reveal metabolic and genetic changes that enhance heterologous production198. Transcriptomics has also been used as a constraint to improve the statistical association of BGCs from genome data to metabolites in metabolome data by identifying which BGCs are in fact expressed under the conditions in which certain metabolite features are observed199.  Methodology and opportunities for data integration Data integration faces several current challenges that are mostly centred around inter-dependencies of the data types and the various data formats that need to ‘talk’ to each other. Fortunately, early tools such as NPLinker190, GraphOmics200 and anvi’o201 are starting to overcome some of these challenges. However, the number of tools available that facilitate and ease the analysis and interpretation of linked data is currently very limited, with users still needing considerable expertise to interpret the results. Furthermore, overparameterization of models is a risk when linking two or multiple datasets. For example, the same information can be present in more than one data type; it is then essential to effectively correct for that to avoid bias. Another bottleneck is getting the data in the appropriate format so it can be used by AI algorithms. Standardization remains the main issue here, particularly in areas such as metabolomics where the data are inherently heterogeneous owing to the nature of the samples.  The fields of genomics, proteomics and transcriptomics have all developed excellent community standards that have encouraged data standardization. Outstanding challenges with separating and identifying individual components from complex mixtures have hampered similar standardization efforts in metabolomics. This is particularly true for the field of natural products, where the range of possible compounds from any source organism can number in the thousands and where many of the structures remain to be discovered. The wide range of sources, processing methods, chromatographic separation conditions and analytical approaches all combine to make data standardization particularly difficult in this area.  Training sets for AI models and benchmarking Requirements for high-quality training sets Machine-readable data are essential for the creation of training sets for AI models. Although the data have often already been collected, they are either converted into an unstandardized written form within publications or not reported at all. Furthermore, well-curated and consistent metadata are also key to training successful models. Indeed, data can be of variable quality owing to inherent differences, for example, in analytical equipment used; however, when this is documented well, researchers can select the relevant data for AI.  Examples of existing natural product-based training and benchmarking sets Chemical structure and biosynthetic data for natural products are now reasonably well standardized and centralized. For example, the NP Atlas170,171, COCONUT202 and LOTUS203 databases provide information about chemical structures, and the MIBiG database contains information on BGCs169. These resources have been applied as training datasets for a wide array of machine learning applications, including the prediction of natural product-likeness of molecules204, de novo BGC predictions16,17, matching of chemical structures to their mass spectra205, automated chemical classification of natural product structures29 and the identification of unknown metabolites from NMR spectral matching47.  Using USIs for mass spectra will enable easy standardized access to the mass spectral data for natural products, including the underlying raw data. In this regard, spectral databases for natural products are under active development, such as the GNPS for MS and MS/MS data and the NP-MRD for NMR data. Importantly, entries in MIBiG, GNPS and the NP-MRD are now all cross-linked to the NP Atlas, creating a central hub that connects structural, spectroscopic and biosynthetic data for natural products.  By contrast, two areas that lack natural product database coverage are catalytic activities of biosynthetic tailoring enzymes (key to predicting natural product structures) and biological activities (key to understanding structure–activity and structure–property relationships). In the former case, the absence of well-curated data for tailoring enzymes limits our ability to predict core structures and their modifications from BGC data. In the second case, the absence of well-standardized bioactivity training sets prevents us from predicting potential target space for newly discovered natural products, or natural product structures predicted from bioinformatic tools. Together, these two issues limit our ability to deliver on the promise offered by massively parallel whole-genome sequencing and large-scale discovery and annotation of BGCs.  Although well-curated training sets for chemical structures and BGCs increasingly meet the demands for creating AI models, almost no high-quality datasets exist for benchmarking the performance of AI models in genome mining (sequence quality dependent) or MS data (instrument parameter dependent). As a result, various datasets are currently used for performance comparisons, making it difficult to reliably establish how well a novel algorithm truly outperforms its predecessor.  Opportunities for generating standardized data sets: the case of biological activities Data on biological activities and modes of action of natural products perhaps constitute the most crucial type of data to guide future natural product drug discovery. At the same time, these data are currently the least standardized and systematically documented. Although databases such as ChEMBL163 can host such data, stored using standardized ontologies206,207, the vast majority of natural product activity data are never deposited and can only be found in the text or supplementary materials of manuscripts. Additionally, the protocols by which activity data have been generated are highly diverse, which further frustrates the direct comparison of datasets generated in different laboratories. A unified effort for data standardization also calls for using standardized growth media and culturing conditions. For example, the International Streptomyces Project (ISP) media have been designed with this in mind. The media can be ordered from the same source, allowing direct comparison of growth conditions. Negative data for molecules not showing activity (equally important for machine learning purposes) are mostly not reported at all, leading to large biases in the primary literature. Populating biological activity databases with targeted standardized datasets and culture conditions would be highly beneficial. Some efforts already do exist that generate specific types of data. For example, the NCI60 panel of tumour cell lines for anticancer drug screening has existed for years, and molecules can be sent to the US National Cancer Institute to be subjected to this panel208. Similarly, CO-ADD constitutes a community-driven approach to antibiotic discovery209, allowing compounds to be sent to a central location to test their activities according to standardized protocols.  Conclusions and outlook In summary, progress in AI for natural product drug discovery is primarily limited by a shortage of large, high-quality datasets rather than a lack of innovative algorithms. As a general recommendation for the field, we caution against using new algorithms solely for their ‘hype’ factor. Instead of jumping on the bandwagon of the latest AI trend, we advise carefully considering which algorithms are best suited for the type and quantity of data available; the fact that natural product datasets are generally considerably smaller than generic computer vision-related datasets, for example, may mean that simpler models with fewer parameters may be more successful and less likely to suffer from overfitting; also in AI, Occam’s razor is more relevant than ever.  That said, breakthroughs in the field have been made by crossing disciplinary boundaries to draw on algorithms from other fields, such as NLP. Algorithmic advances are especially needed to extract meaningful features from heterogeneous data sources with multiple inputs, including chemical spectra, DNA sequences, structures and bioactivity information. Another opportunity for the field is to adopt an ‘active learning’ approach towards dataset generation. By this, we mean characterizing underexplored areas of sequence, chemical, structural or bioactivity space in which gold-standard datasets are lacking to increase the number of effective data points. It is also important to recognize that AI approaches will generally not be able to predict entirely novel chemistry, mechanisms of actions that have never been observed before or completely new catalytic activities of enzymes. Investments in fundamental biochemical research are needed, to shed light on those parts of biochemical space for which AI currently does not yet provide meaningful insights210.  New data-driven AI discoveries depend on underlying databases being preserved and maintained over time. Ironically, although AI is entirely reliant on high-quality data, longitudinal and stable financial support for the maintenance of databases is challenging to obtain. Therefore, for future AI advances, we feel that continued support for database maintenance and interoperability should be a priority for international and national funding agencies. Because of the vast array of data types associated with natural product research it is unlikely that a single monolithic repository will serve the needs of the natural product community. Instead, specialized repositories that focus on different aspects of natural product data (such as structures, BGCs, spectral data and biological activities) must focus on improving interoperability to develop a distributed network of data resources. This interoperability not only must involve the connection of entries between databases but also must consider integrated data deposition and the adoption of common standardization protocols for core data types. There is much to learn about repository structure and governance strategies from other areas of science, such as the Protein Data Bank for structural biology and the Cambridge Structural Database for X-ray crystallography. The natural product community must prioritize and promote these efforts if they are to benefit from the new and exciting applications being offered by AI-based technologies.  Finally, we emphasize that the collective resources of our global scientific community far outweigh the capacity of any single lab. If appropriate incentives and guidelines are available, community-generated and curated datasets can have enormous potential to advance the

"A mystery Large Language Models (LLM) are on fire, capturing public attention by their ability to provide seemingly impressive completions to user prompts (NYT coverage). They are a delicate combination of a radically simplistic algorithm with massive amounts of data and computing power. They are trained by playing a guess-the-next-word game with itself over and over again. Each time, the model looks at a partial sentence and guesses the following word. If it makes it correctly, it will update its parameters to reinforce its confidence; otherwise, it will learn from the error and give a better guess next time.  While the underpinning training algorithm remains roughly the same, the recent increase in model and data size has brought about qualitatively new behaviors such as writing basic code or solving logic puzzles.  How do these models achieve this kind of performance? Do they merely memorize training data and reread it out loud, or are they picking up the rules of English grammar and the syntax of C language? Are they building something like an internal world model—an understandable model of the process producing the sequences?  From various philosophical [1] and mathematical [2] perspectives, some researchers argue that it is fundamentally impossible for models trained with guess-the-next-word to learn the “meanings'' of language and their performance is merely the result of memorizing “surface statistics”, i.e., a long list of correlations that do not reflect a causal model of the process generating the sequence. Without knowing if this is the case, it becomes difficult to align the model to human values and purge spurious correlations picked up by the model [3,4]. This issue is of practical concern since relying on spurious correlations may lead to problems on out-of-distribution data.  The goal of our paper [5] is to explore this question in a carefully controlled setting. As we will discuss, we find interesting evidence that simple sequence prediction can lead to the formation of a world model. But before we dive into technical details, we start with a parable.  A thought experiment Consider the following thought experiment. Imagine you have a friend who enjoys the board game Othello, and often comes to your house to play. The two of you take the competition seriously and are silent during the game except to call out each move as you make it, using standard Othello notation. Now imagine that there is a crow perching outside of an open window, out of view of the Othello board. After many visits from your friend, the crow starts calling out moves of its own—and to your surprise, those moves are almost always legal given the current board.  You naturally wonder how the crow does this. Is it producing legal moves by ""haphazardly stitching together” [3] superficial statistics, such as which openings are common or the fact that the names of corner squares will be called out later in the game? Or is it somehow tracking and using the state of play, even though it has never seen the board? It seems like there's no way to tell.  But one day, while cleaning the windowsill where the crow sits, you notice a grid-like arrangement of two kinds of birdseed--and it looks remarkably like the configuration of the last Othello game you played. The next time your friend comes over, the two of you look at the windowsill during a game. Sure enough, the seeds show your current position, and the crow is nudging one more seed with its beak to reflect the move you just made. Then it starts looking over the seeds, paying special attention to parts of the grid that might determine the legality of the next move. Your friend, a prankster, decides to try a trick: distracting the crow and rearranging some of the seeds to a new position. When the crow looks back at the board, it cocks its head and announces a move, one that is only legal in the new, rearranged position.  At this point, it seems fair to conclude the crow is relying on more than surface statistics. It evidently has formed a model of the game it has been hearing about, one that humans can understand and even use to steer the crow's behavior. Of course, there's a lot the crow may be missing: what makes a good move, what it means to play a game, that winning makes you happy, that you once made bad moves on purpose to cheer up your friend, and so on. We make no comment on whether the crow “understands” what it hears or is in any sense “intelligent”. We can say, however, that it has developed an interpretable (compared to in the crow’s head) and controllable (can be changed with purpose) representation of the game state.  Othello-GPT: a synthetic testbed As a clever reader might have already guessed, the crow is our subject under debate, a large language model.  We are looking into the debate by training a GPT model only on Othello game scripts, termed Othello-GPT. Othello is played by two players (black and white), who alternatively place discs on an 8x8 board. Every move must flip more than one opponent's discs by outflanking/sandwiching them in a straight line. Game ends when no moves could be made and the player with more discs on the board wins.  We choose the game Othello, which is simpler than chess but maintains a sufficiently large game tree to avoid memorization. Our strategy is to see what, if anything, a GPT variant learns simply by observing game transcripts without any a priori knowledge of rules or board structure.   Fig 2: From left to right: the starting board state of Othello; after black places a disc at E3; after white then places a disc at D3. It’s worth pointing out a key difference between our model and Reinforcement Learning models like AlphaGo: to AlphaGo, game scripts are the history used to predict the optimal best next move leading to a win, so the game rule and board structures are baked into it as much as possible; in contrast, game scripts is no different from sequences with a unique generation process to Othello-GPT and to what extent the generation process can be discovered by a large language model is exactly what we are interested in. Therefore, unlike AlphaGo, no knowledge of board structure or game rules is given. The model is rather trained to learn to make legal moves only from lists of moves like: E3, D3, C4… Each of the tiles is tokenized as a single word. The Othello-GPT is then trained to predict the next move given the preceding partial game to capture the distribution of games (sentences) in game datasets.  We found that the trained Othello-GPT usually makes legal moves. The error rate is 0.01%; and for comparison, the untrained Othello-GPT has an error rate of 93.29%. This is much like the observation in our parable that the crow was announcing the next moves.  Probes To test this hypothesis, we first introduce probing, an established technique in NLP [6] to test for internal representations of information inside neural networks. We will use this technique to identify world models in a synthetic language model if they exist.  The heuristic is simple: for a classifier with constrained capacity, the more informative its input is for a certain target, the higher accuracy it can achieve when trained to predict the target. In this case, the simple classifiers are called probes, which take different activations in the model as input and are trained to predict certain properties of the input sentence, e.g., the part-of-speech tags and parse tree depth. It’s believed that the higher accuracy these classifiers can get, the better the activations have learned about these real-world properties, i.e., the existence of these concepts in the model.  One early work [7] probed sentence embeddings with 10 linguistic properties like tense, parsing tree depth, and top constituency. Later people found that syntax trees are embedded in the contextualized word embeddings of BERT models [8].  Back to the mystery on whether large language models are learning surface statistics or world models, there have been some tantalizing clues suggesting language models may build interpretable “world models” with probing techniques. They suggest language models can develop world models for very simple concepts in their internal representations (layer-wise activations), such as color [9], direction [10], or track boolean states during synthetic tasks [11]. They found that the representations for different classes of these concepts are easier to separate compared to those from randomly-initialized models. By comparing probe accuracies from trained language models with the probe accuracies from randomly-initialized baseline, they conclude that the language models are at least picking up something about these properties.  Probing Othello-GPT As a first step of looking into it, we apply probes to our trained Othello-GPT. For each internal representation in the model, we have a ground truth board state that it corresponds to. We then train 64 independent two-layer MLP classifiers to classify each of the 64 tiles on Othello board into three states, black, blank, and white, by taking the internal representations from Othello-GPT as input. It turns out that the error rates of these probes are reduced from 26.2% on a randomly-initialized Othello-GPT to only 1.7% on a trained Othello-GPT. This suggests that there exists a world model in the internal representation of a trained Othello-GPT. Now, what is its shape? Do these concepts organize themselves in the high-dimensional space with a geometry similar to their corresponding tiles on an Othello board?  Since the probe we trained for each tile essentially keeps its knowledge about the board with a prototype vector for that tile, we interpret it as the concept vector for that tile. For the 64 concept vectors at hand, we apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality to 3 to plot the 64 dots below, each corresponding to one tile on the Othello board. We connect two dots if the two tiles they correspond to are direct neighbors. If the connection is horizontal on board, we color it with an orange gradient palette, changing along with the vertical position of the two tiles. Similarly, we use a blue gradient palette for vertical connections. Dots for the upper left corner ([0, 0]) and lower right corner ([7, 7]) are labeled.  By contrasting with the geometry of probes trained on a randomly-initialized GPT model (left), we can confirm that the training of Othello-GPT gives rise to an emergent geometry of “draped cloth on a ball” (right), resembling the Othello board.   Fig 3: Left: probe geometry of a randomly-initialized Othello-GPT; right: probe geometry of a trained Othello-GPT.  Finding these probes is like discovering the board made of seeds on the crow's windowsill. Their existence excites us but we are not yet sure if the crow is relying on them to announce the next moves.    Controlling model predictions via uncovered world models Remember the prank in the thought experiment? We devise a method to change the world representation of Othello-GPT by changing its intermediate activations as the neural network computes layer by layer, on the fly, in the hope that the next-step predictions of the model can be changed accordingly as if made from this new world representation. This addresses some potential criticisms that these world representations are not actually contributing to the final prediction of Othello-GPT.  The following picture shows one such intervention case: on the bottom left is the world state in the model’s mind before the intervention, and to its right is the post-intervention world state we chose and the consequent post-intervention made by the model. What we are thinking of doing is flipping E6 from black to white and hope the model will make different next-step predictions based on the changed world state. This change in the world state will cause a change in the set of legal next moves according to the rule of Othello. If the intervention is successful, the model will change its prediction accordingly.   Fig 4: an example of the intervention experiment. We evaluate this by comparing the ground-truth post-intervention legal moves returned by the Othello engine and those returned by the model. It turns out that it achieves an average error of only 0.12 tiles. It shows that the world representations are more than probable from the internal activations of the language model, but are also directly used for prediction. This ties back to the prank in the parable where moving the seeds around can change how the crow thinks about the game and makes the next move prediction.  A more stringent test is done by intervening the board state in the model’s mind into ones that are unreachable from any input sequences, e.g., boards with two disconnected blocks of discs. The idea is similar to Fischer random chess—players’ abilities are tested by playing under impossible board states in normal chess. The systematic evaluation result is equally good, which provides evidence that further disentangles the world model from sequence statistics.  An application for interpretability Let’s take a step back and think about what such a reliable intervention technique brings to us. It allows us to ask the counterfactual question: what would the model predict if F6 were white, even no input sequence can ever lead to such a board state? It allows us to imaginarily go down the untaken path in the garden of forking paths.  Among many other newly-opened possibilities, we introduce the Attribution via Intervention method to attribute a valid next-step move to each tile on the current board and create “latent saliency maps” by coloring each tile with the the attribution score. It’s done by simply comparing the predicted probabilities between factual and counterfactual predictions (each counterfactual prediction is made by the model from the world state where one of the occupied tiles is flipped).  For instance, how do we get the saliency value for square D4 in the upper-left plot below? We first run the model normally to get the next-step probability predicted for D6 (the square we attribute); then we run the model again but intervene a white D4 to a black D4 during the run, and save the probability for D6 again; by taking the difference between the two probability values, we know how the current state of D4 is contributing to the prediction of D6. And the same process holds for other occupied squares.   Fig 5: for each of the 8 plots, the text above is the next-move it is attributing (also enclosed). For other tiles on the board, the darker red, the more important it is for the attributed move. For example, in the upper left plot, D5 contributes the most to the prediction of D6.  The figure below shows 8 such “latent saliency maps” made from Othello-GPT. These maps show that the method precisely attributes the prediction to tiles that make the prediction legal—the same-color at the other end of the straight-line “sandwich” and the tiles in between that are occupied by the opponent discs. From these saliency maps, an Othello player can understand Othello-GPT’s goal, to make legal moves; and a person who does not know Othello could perhaps induce the rule. Different from most existing interpretability methods, the heatmap created is not based on the input to the model but rather the model’s latent space. Thus we call it a “latent saliency map”.  Discussion: where are we? Back to the question we have at the beginning: do language models learn world models or just surface statistics? Our experiment provides evidence supporting that these language models are developing world models and relying on the world model to generate sequences. Let’s zoom back and see how we get there.  Initially, in the set-up of Othello-GPT, we find that the trained Othello-GPT usually makes legal moves. I’d like to visualize where we are as follow:   , where two unrelated processes—(1) a human-understandable World Model and (2) a black-box neural network—reach highly consistent next-move predictions. This is not a totally surprising fact given we have witnessed so many abilities of large language models, but it’s a solid question to ask about the interplay between the mid-stage products from the two processes: the human-understandable world representations and the incomprehensible high-dimensional space in an LLM.  We first study the direction from internal activations to world representations. By training probes, we are able to predict world representations from the internal activations of Othello-GPT.   How is the other way around? We devised the intervention technique to change the internal activation so that it can represent a different world representation given by us. And we found this works concordantly with the higher layers of the language model—these layers can make next-move predictions solely based on the intervened internal activations without unwanted influence from the original input sequence. In this sense, we established a bidirectional mapping and opened the possibility of many applications, like the latent saliency map.   Putting these two links into the first flow chart, we’ve arrived at a deeply satisfying picture: two systems—a powerful yet black-box neural network and a human-understandable world model—not only predict consistently, but also share a unified mid-stage representation.   Still, many exciting open questions remain unanswered. In our work, the form of world representation (64 tiles, each with 3 possible states) and the game engine (game rule) are known. Can we reverse-engineer them rather than assuming knowing them? It’s also worth noting that the world representation (board state) serves as a “sufficient statistic” of the input sequence for next-move prediction. Whereas for real LLMs, we are at our best only know a small fraction of the world model behind. How to control LLMs in a minimally invasive (maintaining other world representations) yet effective way remains an important question for future research."
https://towardsdatascience.com/positive-use-cases-of-deepfakes-49f510056387	Positive Use Cases of Synthetic Media (aka Deepfakes)	Technology is an excellent enabler and can be very empowering. New ideas and capabilities for empowerment have emerged because of the advancements in data science and Artificial intelligence. AI can create possibilities and opportunities for all people, regardless of who they are and how they listen, speak, or communicate.  The Book is now available at Amazon — https://www.amazon.com/Deepfakes-aka-Synthetic-Media-Humanity-ebook/dp/B0B846YCNJ/  AI-Generated Synthetic media, also known as deepfakes, have many positive use cases. AI-Generated Synthetic Media, aka Deepfakes, advances have clear benefits in certain areas, such as accessibility, education, film production, criminal forensics, and artistic expression.  In this article, I will explore some of the positive use cases of deepfakes. I firmly believe that as technology evolves and societies adjudicate the deepfake phenomenon, most of the use cases of deepfakes will be to improve people’s lives and empower communities and institutions.  Technology can give people a voice, purpose, and an ability to make impact at scale and with speed.  Accessibility Artificial intelligence can build tools to hear, see, and soon with Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), reason with increasing accuracy. AI-Generated Synthetic media can help make the accessibility tools smarter and, in some cases, even affordable and personalizable, which can help people augment their agency and gain independence. Technology, specifically AI-based tools, can bring accessible solutions to all.  Deepfake can accelerate the accessibility quest to improve equity.  Microsoft’s Seeing.ai and Google’s Lookout leverage AI for recognition and synthetic voice to narrate objects, people, and the world. AI-Generated synthetic media can power personalized assistive navigation apps for pedestrian travel.  Canetroller, a haptic cane controller, can help visually impaired navigate the virtual reality world with simulation and cane interactions. It can enable people with visual impairments to navigate a virtual environment by transferring their cane skills into the virtual world. The technology can help bring equity and empowerment.  For the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients’ synthetic voice is very empowering as the horrible disease impacts the ability to speak, communicate, and motor skills. Imagine being able to talk in your own voice with your loved ones even after losing the ability to speak. Team Gleason, which provides technology, equipment, and services for people living with ALS, is working with technology companies to enable and develop AI-Generated synthetic media scenarios for people living with ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease).  There are other use cases of Synthetic voice. VOCALiD leverages voicebank and proprietary voice blending technology to create unique vocal personas for any device that turns text into speech for those with speech and hearing difficulties. Synthetic voice is also essential to enable such patients to be independent. Deepfake voice can also help with speech impediments since birth.  Education Deepfake technology facilitates numerous possibilities in the education domain. Schools and teachers have been using media, audio, video in the classroom for quite some time. Deepfakes can help an educator to deliver innovative lessons that are far more engaging than traditional visual and media formats.  AI-Generated synthetic media can bring historical figures back to life for a more engaging and interactive classroom. A synthetic video of reenactments or voice and video of a historical figure may have more impact, engagement, and will be a better learning tool. For example, JFK’s resolution to end the cold was speech, which was never delivered, was recreated using synthetic voice with his voice and speaking style will clearly get students to learn about the issue in a creative way.  Synthetic human anatomy, sophisticated industrial machinery, and complex industrial projects can be modeled and simulated in a mixed reality world to teach students and collaborate using Microsoft Hololens.  Creative use of synthetic voice and video can increase overall success and learning outcomes with scale and limited cost.  Art For many decades, Hollywood has used high-end CGI, VFX, and SFX technologies to create artificial but believable worlds for compelling storytelling. In the 1994’s movie, Forest Gump, the protagonist meets JFK and other historical figures. The creation of the scenario and effect was accomplished using CGI and different techniques with millions of dollars. These days sophisticated CGI and VFX technologies are used in movies to generate synthetic media for telling a captivating story.  Deepfakes can democratize the costly VFX technology as a powerful tool for independent storytellers at a fraction of the cost.  Deepfakes can be a great tool to realistically realize the primary tenant of reflection, stretching, contortion, and appropriation of real events in comedy or parody. AI-Generated synthetic media can bring unprecedented opportunities in the entertainment business, and we see a lot of realization of the opportunity by independent creators or YouTube. Some great examples of movie deepfake using GANS are YouTube creators like ctrl shift face and shamook.  Cultural and entertainment businesses can use deepfakes for artistic purposes. Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, created an exhibition called Dalí lives, bringing him back to life using deepfakes for visitors to interact and take a selfie with surrealist painter Salvador Dalí. Similarly, Samsung’s AI lab in Moscow brought Mona Lisa to life by using Deepfake technology.  In the video gaming industry, AI-generated graphics and imagery can accelerate the speed of game creation. Nvidia demoed a hybrid gaming environment created by deepfakes and is working on bringing it to market soon.  Audio storytelling and book narration is another good use case of synthetic voice. The author’s synthetic voice font can be used to create the author’s book’s audio format. Businesses can use synthetic voice-overs of the same actor in different languages to broaden the reach of their content. The creative voice technology to implement the above scenarios must be used ethically and responsibly[1] with a robust consent framework as it has a direct impact on the livelihood and agency of a voice artist.  Autonomy & Expression Synthetic media can help human rights activists and journalists to remain anonymous in dictatorial and oppressive regimes. Using technology to report out atrocities on traditional or social media can be very empowering for citizen journalists and activists. Deepfake can be used to anonymize voice and faces to protect their privacy.  Deepfakes may be used to create avatar experiences for individuals online for self-expression. Personal digital avatar gives autonomy and can help individuals to extend their purpose, ideas, and belief and enable self-expression, which otherwise may be difficult for some[2]. Individuals suffering from certain physical or mental disabilities could use synthetic avatars of themselves for online self-expression.  Deepfakes can give individuals new tools for self-expression and integration in the online world.  Deep Empathy, a UNICEF and MIT project, utilizes deep learning to learn the characteristics of Syrian neighborhoods affected by conflict. It then simulates how cities around the world would look amid a similar conflict. The project created synthetic war-torn images of Boston, London and other key cities around the world to help increase empathy for victims of a disaster region.  There are voice technology startups that will create synthetic voice as a new kind of bereavement therapy or help people remember the deceased and connect with them.  Reach and Message Amplification In April last year, a health charity partnered with David Beckham to produce a video and voice campaign to help end malaria. In the “malaria no more” campaign, Beckham spoke nine languages seamlessly for public appeal. The social campaign was a great example of using deepfakes to broaden the reach of a public message. Synthesia, the company behind the Beckham video, and VOCALiD, a voice startup, create tools to natively localize video and audio content for learning tools, brand marketing, audience engagement, customer service, and public messaging to broaden the reach and amplification of the message.  Text to Speech models can assist podcast creation by podcaster’s voice font to create synthetic audio from text with fewer mistakes and more speed.  Deepfakes can be used by influencers to broaden their reach and increase their audience. Using deepfakes, a brand can reach many customers with highly targeted and personalized messaging. Zalando, with Cara Delevigne executed a campaign, which can become even more personal with influencer video shots and voice fonts. Lil Miquela, a CG 19-year old “taco truck expert” and social media personality, has 2.4m followers. Digital Models, AI-Generated deepfakes are becoming a new trend in fashion and brand marketing.  AI Foundation is creating personal AI for influencers and celebrities, with their consent, to engage and amplify their reach with the audience, create deeper engagement with the fans, and deliver personal experiences at scale. AI Foundation recently launched a personal digital avatar of Deepak Chopra.  Deepfakes will take influencer marketing to another level.  A few days ahead of the Delhi elections, a politician in India created a deepfake to reach out to different linguistic voters. It was the first documented use of a deepfake by a political party for campaigning purposes.  Public Safety & Digital reconstruction Reconstructing the crime scene is a forensic science and art, using inductive and deductive reasoning and evidence. AI-Generated synthetic media can help reconstruct the scene with the interrelationship of spatial and temporal artifacts. In 2018, a team of civil investigators used cell phone videos, autopsy reports, and surveillance footage to reconstruct a virtual crime scene.  Innovation Data and AI are helping in digital transformation and automation in many industries. Deepfake or AI-Generated Synthetic media is becoming a foundation to engage customers and provide personalized value. Reuters demonstrated a fully AI-Generated deepfake presenter-led sports news summary system to help personalize news at scale. In the fashion retail business, deepfakes can help turn customers into models by virtually trying out the latest apparel and accessories[3].  An exciting app will capture customers’ faces, bodies, and even micro mannerisms to generate a deepfake and try out the latest fashion trends. Data Grid, a Japanese artificial intelligence company, created an artificial intelligence engine that automatically generates virtual models for advertising and fashion. The deepfake approach gives the ability for brands to have a virtual trial room for users to experience products before buying them. Retail brands can also engage customers at home by creating an AI-generated mixed reality world to try, furnish, and decorate their space.  Microsoft Hololens opens enterprise and industrial mixed reality innovative scenarios to provide value. Product Visualize lets customers explore an industrial product visually. Teams and technicians can work together in industrial products together with Remote Assist, an mixed reality collaboration tool.  AI technologies can also be used to enhance and improve the resolution of low-resolution images. These enhancing techniques to build deepfakes are super useful for older media or media created by low-resolution lenses. Google published a paper to create high-resolution images using Latent Adversarial Generator. Microsoft Research published an article to enhance and fix imperfections of the degraded photos using triplet Domain Translation Networks.  Synthetic data can empower medical researchers to develop new ways of treating diseases without actual patient data. They can use AI-Generated synthetic data for the training model to yield similar results. NVIDIA, MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science and the Mayo Clinic showed how they used GANs–algorithms that iterate and improve by competing against each other–to create synthetic brain MRI images with tumors[4]. By training algorithms on synthetic medical images and combining them with just 10% real images, they became just as good at spotting tumors as algorithms trained only on real images.  Deepfakes may also mitigate some of the patient privacy concerns.  A vast amount of training data is required by deep learning algorithms to create an efficient model and even to develop deepfake detection models. Since there are not many real-life deepfakes, companies like Facebook had to create synthetic media and deepfakes for the Facebook Deepfake detection challenge[5]  Conclusion Deepfakes provide an excellent opportunity to have a positive impact on our lives. AI-Generated synthetic media can be very empowering and a great enabler. Deepfakes can give people a voice, purpose, and ability to impact scale and speed. New ideas and capabilities for empowerment have emerged from all walks of life, from art, expression, and public safety to accessibility and business. Deepfakes can create possibilities for all people irrespective of their limitations by augmenting their agency  However, as access to synthetic media technology increases, so does the risk of exploitation. Deepfakes can be used to damage reputations, fabricate evidence, defraud the public, and undermine trust in democratic institutions.

Companion robots may help socially isolated people avoid the health risks of being alone  Companion robots enhanced with artificial intelligence may one day help alleviate the loneliness epidemic, suggests a new report from researchers at Auckland, Duke, and Cornell Universities.  Their report, appearing in the July 12 issue of Science Robotics, maps some of the ethical considerations for governments, policy makers, technologists, and clinicians, and urges stakeholders to come together to rapidly develop guidelines for trust, agency, engagement, and real-world efficacy.  It also proposes a new way to measure whether a companion robot is helping someone.  “Right now, all the evidence points to having a real friend as the best solution,” said Murali Doraiswamy, MBBS, FRCP, professor of Psychiatry and Geriatrics at Duke University and member of the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences. “But until society prioritizes social connectedness and eldercare, robots are a solution for the millions of isolated people who have no other solutions.”   Duke professor of psychiatry & geriatrics P. Murali Doraiswamy, MBBS, FRCP The number of Americans with no close friends has quadrupled since 1990, according to the Survey Center on American Life. Increased loneliness and social isolation may affect a third of the world population, and come with serious health consequences, such as increased risk for mental illness, obesity, dementia, and early death. Loneliness may even be as pernicious a health factor as smoking cigarettes, according to the U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy, M.D.  While it is increasingly difficult to make new friends as an adult to help offset loneliness, making a companion robot to support socially isolated older adults may prove to be a promising solution.  “AI presents exciting opportunities to give companion robots greater skills to build social connection,” said Elizabeth Broadbent, Ph.D., professor of Psychological Medicine at Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland. “But we need to be careful to build in rules to ensure they are moral and trustworthy.”  Social robots like the ElliQ have had thousands of interactions with human users, nearly half related to simple companionship, including company over a cup of tea or coffee. A growing body of research on companion robots suggests they can reduce stress and loneliness and can help older people remain healthy and active in their homes.  Newer robots embedded with advanced AI programs may foster stronger social connections with humans than earlier generations of robots. Generative AI like ChatGPT, which is based on large language models, allows robots to engage in more spontaneous conversations, and even mimic the voices of old friends and loved ones who have passed away.  Doctors are mostly on board, too, the authors point out. A Sermo survey of 307 care providers across Europe and the United States showed that 69% of physicians agreed that social robots could provide companionship, relieve isolation, and potentially improve patients’ mental health. Seventy percent of doctors also felt insurance companies should cover the cost of companion robots if they prove to be effective friendship supplement. How to measure a robot’s impact, though, remains tricky.  This lack of measurability highlights the need to develop patient-rated outcome measures, such as the one being developed by the authors. The “Companion Robot Impact Scale” (Co-Bot-I-7) aims to establish the impact on physical health and loneliness, and is showing that companion machines might already be proving effective.  Early results from Broadbent’s lab, for example, find that amiable androids help reduce stress and even promote skin healing after a minor wound.  “With the right ethical guidelines,” the authors conclude in their report, “we may be able to build on current work to use robots to create a healthier society.”  In addition to Dr. Doraiswamy and Professor Broadbent, study authors include Mark Billinghurst, Ph.D., and Samantha Boardman, M.D.  Professor Broadbent and Dr. Doraiswamy have served as advisors to Sermo and technology companies. Dr. Doraiswamy, Professor Broadbent, and Dr. Boardman are co-developers of the Co-Bot-I-7 scale.
https://www.wired.com/story/senate-ai-forum-musk-zuckerberg/	Inside the Senate’s Private AI Meeting With Tech’s Billionaire Elites	"US SENATORS ARE proving slow studies when it comes to the generative artificial intelligence tools that are poised to upend life as we know it. But they’ll be tested soon—and the rest of us through them—if their new private tutors are to be trusted.  In a historic first, yesterday upwards of 60 senators sat like school children—not allowed to speak or even raise their hands—in a private briefing where some 20 Silicon Valley CEOs, ethicists, academics, and consumer advocates prophesied about AI’s potential to upend, heal, or even erase life as we knew it.  “It’s important for us to have a referee,” Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and X (formerly Twitter), told a throng of paparazzi-like press corps waiting on the sidewalk outside the briefing. “[It] may go down in history as very important to the future of civilization.”  The weight of the moment is lost on no one, especially after Musk warned senators inside the room of the “civilizational risks” of generative AI.  As many senators grapple with AI basics, there’s still time to influence the Senate’s collective thinking before lawmakers try to do what they’ve failed to do in recent years: regulate the emerging disruptive tech.  Inside the briefing room there was consensus on the dais that the federal government’s regulatory might is needed. At one point, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat who organized the briefing, asked his assembled guests, “Does the government need to play a role in regulating AI?”  “Every single person raised their hand, even though they had diverse views,” Schumer continued. “So that gives us a message here: We have to try to act, as difficult as the process may be.”  The raising of diverse hands felt revelatory to many.  “I think people all agreed that this is something that we need the government’s leadership on,” said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. “Some disagreement about how it should happen, but unanimity [that] this is important and urgent.”  The devilish details are haunting, though. Because generative AI is so all-encompassing, a debate over regulating it can quickly expand to include every divisive issue under the sun, something that was on display in the briefing right alongside the show of unity, according to attendees who spoke to WIRED.  To the surprise of many, the session was replete with specifics. Some attendees brought up their need for more highly skilled workers, while Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates focused on feeding the globe’s hungry. Some envision a sweeping new AI agency, while others argue that existing entities—like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which was mentioned by name—are better suited to regulate in real time (well, AI time).  “It was a very good pairing. Better than I expected,” says Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Wyoming Republican who attended the briefing. “I kind of expected it to be a nothingburger, and I learned a lot. I thought it was extremely helpful, so I’m really glad I went. Really glad.”  FEATURED VIDEO   Jacksepticeye Asks His AI Clone Increasingly Complex Questions  MOST POPULAR How to Get Free Ebooks on ‘Stuff Your E-Reader’ Day GEAR How to Get Free Ebooks on ‘Stuff Your E-Reader’ Day MEDEA GIORDANO  The Gruesome Story of How Neuralink’s Monkeys Actually Died BUSINESS The Gruesome Story of How Neuralink’s Monkeys Actually Died DHRUV MEHROTRA  The Mysterious 'Warming Hole' in the Middle of the US SCIENCE The Mysterious 'Warming Hole' in the Middle of the US MATT SIMON  How a ‘Digital Peeping Tom’ Unmasked Porn Actors IDEAS How a ‘Digital Peeping Tom’ Unmasked Porn Actors KASHMIR HILL  Like many in the room, Lummis’ ears perked when a speaker called out Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act—a legislative shield that protects tech firms from liability for content users publish on their social media platforms.  “One of the speakers said, ‘Make users and creators of the technology accountable, not immune from liability,’” Lummis says, reading from her exhaustive hand-scribbled notes. “In other words, he specifically said, ‘Do not create a Section 230 for AI.’ Lummis adds that the speaker who proposed this—she didn’t identify him— “was sitting next to [Meta CEO Mark] Zuckerberg and he said it—one or two seats away, which I thought was fascinating.”  Beyond the diverse opinions of lawmakers, there were also disagreements among the experts invited to speak at the private briefing. The forum’s attendees and other tech leaders are talking about building and expanding on gains from AI, but many Latinos still lack broadband internet access, says attendee Janet Murguía, president of Hispanic civil rights organization UnidosUS. That reality underscores how “existing infrastructure gaps keep us from being at the front door of AI,” she says.  Murguía wants lawmakers to think about the needs of the Hispanic community to prioritize job training, fight job displacement, and guard against “surveillance that gets away from the values of our democracy.” In particular, she mentioned AI-driven tools like geolocation tracking and face recognition, pointing to a report released earlier this week that found federal law enforcement agencies that are using face recognition lack safeguards to protect people’s privacy and civil rights.  The resounding message she heard from tech CEOs was a desire for US leadership in AI policy. “Whether it was Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk or Bill Gates or [Alphabet CEO] Sundar Pichai, there was a clear resonance that the US must take the lead in AI policy and regulation,” she says.  Murguía was glad to see women like Maya Wiley from the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and union leaders at the forum, representation she called impressive and historic. But she wants to see people from more segments of society in the room at the next forum, saying, “We can’t have the same small circle of folks that aren’t diverse making these decisions.”  In her remarks during yesterday’s briefing, American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten highlighted WIRED reporting that $400 can bankroll a disinformation campaign. Later, Tristan Harris from the Center for Humane Technology talked about how $800 and a few hours of work stripped Meta’s Llama 2 language model of safety controls and made it share instructions on how to make a biological weapon.  “It’s like we were having a debate about how little it costs to ruin the world,” Weingarten says, pointing to Musk’s comment about how AI could spell the end of civilization.  Weingarten credits Schumer for bringing people together at a critical moment in history, when there’s tremendous potential for AI to do good for humanity and tremendous potential to undermine democracy and human decision-making. Teachers and students deserve protections from inequality, identity theft, disinformation, and other harms that AI can fuel, she says, and meaningful federal legislation should protect privacy and seek to resolve issues like job displacement.

The innovation would not have been sustainable without a real commitment to safety,” says Weingarten.  Ahead of the forum, Inioluwa Deb Raji, a UC Berkeley researcher, argued that the most reliable experts on real-world harms caused by AI come from outside corporations. She told WIRED she was thankful she was in the room to reiterate her opinion.  A few times, she heard people argue that the reason major AI companies and the Biden administration had agreed corporations could lead voluntary commitments to assess AI systems before deployment was because those companies had built the technology and therefore understand it best.  She said perhaps that’s true, but hearing from people impacted by AI systems and examining how they’re affected offers another form of valid and important expertise that can inform regulation of AI and help develop standards. She knows from experience auditing AI systems for years that these systems don’t always work very well and can fail in unexpected ways and endanger human lives. The work of independent auditors, she argued during the briefing, opens things up to more investigation by civil society.  “I’m glad I could be there to bring up some noncorporate talking points, but I wish I had more backup,” Raji says.  Some commonly known tensions came up, such as whether open- or closed-source AI is best, and the importance of addressing the ways AI models that exist today harm people, rather than only looking at existential risks that don’t exist yet. While Musk, who signed a letter in favor of a pause in AI development earlier this year, talked about the possibility of AI wiping out civilization, Raji criticized Tesla’s Autopilot AI, which has faced criticism following passenger deaths.  “Maybe I should have cared a little more about the independent wealth of people sitting two steps away from me, but I feel like it wasn’t that intimidating because I knew that they were repeating points that I’ve heard before from corporate representatives at these companies about these exact same topics, so I had a sense of what to expect,” she says.  Despite some disagreements, Raji says, some of the strongest and most surprising moments of the meeting occurred when consensus emerged that government regulation of AI is necessary. Those moments made it seem there may be a path to bipartisan legislation. “That was actually pretty educational for me, and probably for the senators,” she says.  There’s still an aversion to new regulations among many Republicans, which is why Senate Commerce chair Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, was struck by how Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella framed the challenge.  “‘When it comes to AI, we shouldn’t be thinking about autopilot—like, you need to have copilots,'"" Cantwell says, paraphrasing Nadella's comments. ""So who’s going to be watching, you know, this activity and making sure that it’s done correctly?”   MOST POPULAR How to Get Free Ebooks on ‘Stuff Your E-Reader’ Day GEAR How to Get Free Ebooks on ‘Stuff Your E-Reader’ Day MEDEA GIORDANO  The Gruesome Story of How Neuralink’s Monkeys Actually Died BUSINESS The Gruesome Story of How Neuralink’s Monkeys Actually Died DHRUV MEHROTRA  The Mysterious 'Warming Hole' in the Middle of the US SCIENCE The Mysterious 'Warming Hole' in the Middle of the US MATT SIMON  How a ‘Digital Peeping Tom’ Unmasked Porn Actors IDEAS How a ‘Digital Peeping Tom’ Unmasked Porn Actors KASHMIR HILL  While all the CEOs, union bosses, and civil rights advocates were asked to raise their hands at points, one flaw with muzzling senators, according to critics on both sides of the proverbial aisle, is that lawmakers weren’t easily able to game out where their allies are in the Senate. And coalitions are key to compromise.  “There’s no feeling in the room,” says Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat. “Closed-door [sessions] for tech giants to come in and talk to senators and answer no tough questions is a terrible precedent for trying to develop any kind of legislation.”  While Warren sat in the front row—close enough so the assembled saw the whites of her fiery, consumer-focused eyes—other critics boycotted the affair, even as they sought out the throngs of reporters huddled in the halls.  “My concern is that [Schumer’s] legislation is leading to nowhere. I mean, I haven’t seen any indication he’s actually going to put real legislation on the floor. It’s a little bit like with antitrust the last two years, he talks about it constantly and does nothing about it,” says Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican. “Part of what this is is a lot of song and dance that covers the fact that actually nothing is advancing. The whole fact that it’s not public, it’s just absurd.”  Absurd or not, some inside were placated, in part, because senators were reminded that AI isn’t just our future, it’s been in our lives for years—from social media to Google searches to self-driving cars and video doorbells—without destroying the world.  “I learned that we’re in good shape, that I’m not overly concerned about it,” says Senator Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican. “I think artificial intelligence has been around for decades, most of it machine learning.”  See What’s Next in Tech With the Fast Forward Newsletter A weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring AI advances and other technology set to change our lives.

Marshall stands out as an outlier, though his laissez-faire thinking is becoming in vogue in the GOP, which critics say is due to all the lobbying from the very firms whose leaders were in yesterday’s briefing.  “The good news is, the United States is leading the way on this issue. I think as long as we stay on the front lines, like we have the military weapons advancement, like we have in satellite investments, we’re gonna be just fine,” Marshall says. “I’m very confident we’re moving in the right direction.”  Still, studious attendees left with a renewed sense of urgency, even if that involves first studying a technology few truly understand, including those on the dais. It seems the more senators learn about the sweeping scope of generative AI, the more they recognize there’s no end to the Senate’s new regulatory role.  “Are we ready to go out and write legislation? Absolutely not,” says Senator Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican who helped Schumer run the bipartisan AI forums, the next of which will focus on innovation. “We’re not there.”  In what was once heralded as the “world’s greatest deliberative body,” even the timeline for legislation is debatable. “Everyone’s nodding their head saying, ‘Yeah, this is something we need to act on,’ so now the question is, ‘How long does it take to get to a consensus?’” says Senator John Hickenlooper, a Colorado Democrat. “But in broad strokes, I think that it’s not unreasonable to expect to get something done next year.”"
https://www.wired.com/story/prisoners-training-ai-finland/	These Prisoners Are Training AI	ACROSS A STERILE white table in a windowless room, I’m introduced to a woman in her forties. She has a square jaw and blonde hair that has been pulled back from her face with a baby-blue scrunchie. “The girls call me Marmalade,” she says, inviting me to use her prison nickname. Early on a Wednesday morning, Marmalade is here, in a Finnish prison, to demonstrate a new type of prison labor.  The table is bare except for a small plastic bottle of water and an HP laptop. During three-hour shifts, for which she’s paid €1.54 ($1.67) an hour, the laptop is programmed to show Marmalade short chunks of text about real estate and then ask her yes or no questions about what she’s just read. One question asks: “is the previous paragraph referring to a real estate decision, rather than an application?”  “It’s a little boring,” Marmalade shrugs. She’s also not entirely sure of the purpose of this exercise. Maybe she is helping to create a customer service chatbot, she muses.  In fact, she is training a large language model owned by Metroc, a Finnish startup that has created a search engine designed to help construction companies find newly approved building projects. To do that, Metroc needs data labelers to help its models understand clues from news articles and municipality documents about upcoming building projects. The AI has to be able to tell the difference between a hospital project that has already commissioned an architect or a window fitter, for example, and projects that might still be hiring.  Around the world, millions of so-called “clickworkers” train artificial intelligence models, teaching machines the difference between pedestrians and palm trees, or what combination of words describe violence or sexual abuse. Usually these workers are stationed in the global south, where wages are cheap. OpenAI, for example, uses an outsourcing firm that employs clickworkers in Kenya, Uganda, and India. That arrangement works for American companies, operating in the world’s most widely spoken language, English. But there are not a lot of people in the global south who speak Finnish.  That’s why Metroc turned to prison labor. The company gets cheap, Finnish-speaking workers, while the prison system can offer inmates employment that, it says, prepares them for the digital world of work after their release. Using prisoners to train AI creates uneasy parallels with the kind of low-paid and sometimes exploitive labor that has often existed downstream in technology. But in Finland, the project has received widespread support.  “There's this global idea of what data labor is. And then there's what happens in Finland, which is very different if you look at it closely,” says Tuukka Lehtiniemi, a researcher at the University of Helsinki, who has been studying data labor in Finnish prisons.  For four months, Marmalade has lived here, in Hämeenlinna prison. The building is modern, with big windows. Colorful artwork tries to enforce a sense of cheeriness on otherwise empty corridors. If it wasn’t for the heavy gray security doors blocking every entry and exit, these rooms could easily belong to a particularly soulless school or university complex.

Instead, Hämeenlinna is the country’s highest-security institution housing exclusively female inmates. Marmalade has been sentenced to six years. Under privacy rules set by the prison, WIRED is not able to publish Marmalade’s real name, exact age, or any other information that could be used to identify her. But in a country where prisoners serving life terms can apply to be released after 12 years, six years is a heavy sentence. And like the other 100 inmates who live here, she is not allowed to leave.  Hämeenlinna prison exterior Hämeenlinna PrisonCOURTESY OF RISE When Marmalade first arrived, she would watch the other women get up and go to work each morning: they could volunteer to clean, do laundry, or sew their own clothes. And for a six hour shift, they would receive roughly €6 ($6.50). But Marmalade couldn’t bear to take part. “I would find it very tiring,” she says. Instead she was spending long stretches of time in her cell. When a prison counselor suggested she try “AI work,” the short, three-hour shifts appealed to her, and the money was better than nothing. “Even though it’s not a lot, it’s better than staying in the cell,” she says” She’s only done three shifts so far, but already she feels a sense of achievement.  This is one of three Finnish prisons where inmates can volunteer to earn money through data labor. In each one, there are three laptops set up for inmates to take part in this AI work. There are no targets. Inmates are paid by the hour, not by their work’s speed or quality. In Hämeenlinna, around 20 inmates have tried it out, says Minna Inkinen, a prison work instructor, with cropped red hair, who sits alongside Marmalade as we talk. “Some definitely like it more than others”. When I arrive at the prison on a Wednesday morning, the sewing room is already busy. Inmates are huddled over sewing machines or conferring in pairs over mounds of fabric. But the small room where the AI work takes place is entirely empty until Marmalade arrives. There are only three inmates in total who regularly volunteer for AI shifts, Inkinen says, explaining that the other two are currently in court. “I would prefer to do it in a group,” says Marmalade, adding that she keeps the door open so she can chat with the people sewing next door, in between answering questions.

Here, I meet Metroc’s tall and boyish founder and CEO, Jussi Virnala. He leads me to a stiflingly hot phone booth, past a row of indoor swings, a pool table, and a series of men in suits. It’s an exciting week, he explains, with a grin. The company has just announced a €2 million ($2.1 million) funding round which he plans to use to expand across the Nordics. The investors he spoke with were intrigued by the company’s connection to Finland’s prisons, he says. “Everyone was just interested in and excited about what an innovative way to do it,” says Virnala. “I think it’s been really valuable product-wise.”  It was Virnala’s idea to turn to the prisons for labor. The company needed native Finnish speakers to help improve its large language model’s understanding of the construction-specific language. But in a high-wage economy like Finland, finding those data laborers was difficult. The Finnish welfare system’s generous unemployment benefits leaves little incentive for Finns to sign up to low-wage clickwork platforms like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. “Mechanical Turk didn’t have many Finnish-language workers,” says Virnala. At the same time, he adds, automatic translation tools are still no good at Finnish, a language with only 5 million native speakers.  When Virnala pitched his idea to Pia Puolakka, head of the Smart Prison Project at Finland’s prison and probation agency, she was instantly interested, she says. Before the pandemic, another Finnish tech company called Vainu had been using prisoners for data labor. But Vainu abruptly pulled out after a disagreement between cofounders prompted Tuomas Rasila, who had been in charge of the project, to leave the company.  By the time Virnala approached her with his proposal in 2022, Puolakka was eager to resurrect the AI work. Her job is to try and make the relationship between Finnish prisons and the internet more closely resemble the increasingly digital outside world. So far, she has been installing laptops in individual cells so inmates can browse a restricted list of websites and apply for permission to make video calls. She considers data labor just another part of that mission.  The aim is not to replace traditional prison labor, such as making road signs or gardening. It’s about giving prisoners more variety. Data labeling can only be done in three-hour shifts. “It might be tiring to do this eight hours a day, only this type of work,” she says, adding that it would be nice if inmates did the data labeling alongside other types of prison labor. “This type of work is the future, and if we want to prepare prisoners for life outside prison, a life without crime, these types of skills might be at least as important as the traditional work types that prisons provide,” she says.  But how much data labeling offers inmates skills that are transferable to work after prison is unclear. Tuomas Rasila, the now estranged cofounder of Vainu, who managed the prison project there for a year, admits he has no evidence of this; the project wasn’t running for long enough to collect it, he says. “I think asking people, who might feel outside of society, to train the most high-tech aspect of a modern society is an empowering idea.”  MOST POPULAR How to Get Free Ebooks on ‘Stuff Your E-Reader’ Day GEAR How to Get Free Ebooks on ‘Stuff Your E-Reader’ Day MEDEA GIORDANO  The Gruesome Story of How Neuralink’s Monkeys Actually Died BUSINESS The Gruesome Story of How Neuralink’s Monkeys Actually Died DHRUV MEHROTRA  The Mysterious 'Warming Hole' in the Middle of the US SCIENCE The Mysterious 'Warming Hole' in the Middle of the US MATT SIMON  How a ‘Digital Peeping Tom’ Unmasked Porn Actors IDEAS How a ‘Digital Peeping Tom’ Unmasked Porn Actors KASHMIR HILL  However, others consider this new form of prison labor part of a problematic rush for cheap labor that underpins the AI revolution. “The narrative that we are moving towards a fully automated society that is more convenient and more efficient tends to obscure the fact that there are actual human people powering a lot of these systems,” says Amos Toh, a senior researcher focusing on artificial intelligence at Human Rights Watch.  For Toh, the accelerating search for so-called clickworkers has created a trend where companies are increasingly turning to groups of people who have few other options: refugees, populations in countries gripped by economic crisis—and now prisoners.  “This dynamic is a deeply familiar one,” says Toh. “What we are seeing here is part of a broader phenomenon where the labor behind building tech is being outsourced to workers that toil in potentially exploitative working conditions.”  Toh is also skeptical about whether data labor can help inmates build digital skills. “There are many ways in which people in prison can advance themselves, like getting certificates and taking part in advanced education,” he says. “But I'm skeptical about whether doing data labeling for a company at one euro per hour will lead to meaningful advancement.” Hämeenlinna prison does offer inmates online courses in AI, but Marmalade sits blank-faced as staff try to explain its benefits.

Traveling straight from the prison, where women worked for €1.54 an hour, to Metroc’s offices, where the company was celebrating a €2 million funding round, felt jarring. In a café, opposite the grand, domed Helsinki cathedral, Lehtiniemi patiently listens to me describe that feeling.  But Lehtiniemi’s own interviews with inmates have given him a different view—he’s generally positive about the project. On my point about pay disparity, he argues this is not an ordinary workforce in mainstream society. These people are in prison. “Comparing the money I get as a researcher and what the prisoner gets for their prison labor, it doesn't make sense,” he says. “The only negative thing I’ve heard has been that there’s not enough of this work. Only a few people can do it,” he says, referring to the limit of three laptops per prison.  “When we think about data labor, we tend to think about Mechanical Turk, people in the global south or the rural US,” he says. But for him, this is a distinct local version of data labor, which comes with a twist that benefits society. It’s giving prisoners cognitively stimulating work—compared to other prison labor options—while also representing the Finnish language in the AI revolution.  Without this kind of initiative, Lehtiniemi worries that non-English languages are being locked out of this next generation of technology. Smart speakers still struggle to understand Finnish dialects. “Not all Finnish people speak English very well, so there's a need for these local forms of data labeling as well,” Lehtiniemi says. Metroc isn’t the only company that has been forced to get creative about finding Finnish data labor. In 2011, the national library created a game to incentivize volunteers to help digitize its archive. In 2020, broadcaster YLE teamed up with Helsinki University and the state development company VAKE to ask volunteers to donate recordings of them speaking Finnish.

Some are worried it could set a precedent that could introduce more controversial types of data labeling, like moderating violent content, to prisons. “Even if the data being labeled in Finland is uncontroversial right now, we have to think about the precedent it sets,” says Toh. “What stops companies from outsourcing data labeling of traumatic and unsavory content to people in prison, especially if they see this as an untapped labor pool?”  It's also not clear whether labor conditions in Finland's prisons—which famously focus on rehabilitation—could be replicated in other countries with a less progressive approach to justice. In the US, 76 percent of prisoners report that prison labor is mandatory, according to civil rights group, the ACLU. “The prison system in the United States is very, very different from what we have in Finland or Nordic countries. It's a completely different idea,” says Rasila. “In Finland, there is an exclusively positive feeling around the project because everyone knows that this is very voluntary.”  AI companies are only going to need more data labor, forcing them to keep seeking out increasingly unusual labor forces to keep pace. As Metroc plots its expansion across the Nordics and into languages other than Finnish, Virnala is considering whether to expand the prison labor project to other countries. “It’s something we need to explore,” he says.
https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/online-product-reviews-are-becoming-battlefield-modern-ai-rcna94710	Online product reviews are becoming a battlefield for modern AI	On the battlefield of online reviews, it’s AI vs. AI.  Generative artificial intelligence that can spit out human-sounding reviews is being met by AI trained to detect fake reviews. It’s the kind of clash that has implications for consumers as well as the future of content online.  Saoud Khalifah, founder and CEO of Fakespot, a startup that uses AI to detect fraudulent reviews, said his company has seen an influx of AI-generated fake reviews. Fakespot is working on a way to detect content written by AI platforms like ChatGPT.  “The thing that is very different today is that the models are knowledgeable to a point where they can write about anything,” he said.  Fake online reviews have been around about as long as real online reviews, but the issue has taken on new urgency thanks to broader concerns about advanced AI technology that is now widely available on the internet.  After years of policing the issue through case-by-case enforcement, the Federal Trade Commission last month proposed a new rule to crack down on fraudulent reviews. If approved, the rule would ban writing fake reviews, paying for reviews, concealing honest reviews and other deceptive practices — and deliver hefty fines to those who break it.  But just what is or isn’t a fake review is now less clear, and the technology to detect fraudulent reviews is still a work in progress.  “We don’t know — really have no way to know — the extent to which bad actors are actually using any of these tools, and how much may be bot-generated versus human-generated,” Michael Atleson, an attorney in the FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices, said. “It’s really more of a serious concern, and it’s just a microcosm of the concerns that these chatbots are going to be used to create all kinds of fake content online.”  There are some indications that AI-generated reviews are already common. CNBC reported in April that some reviews on Amazon had clear indications of AI involvement, with many starting off with the phrase, “As an AI language model ...”  Amazon is among the many online sellers that have battled fake reviews for years. A spokesperson said the company receives millions of reviews each week and that it proactively blocked 200 million suspected fake reviews in 2022. The company uses a combination of human investigators and AI to spot fake reviews, employing machine learning models that analyze factors like a user’s review history, sign-in activity and relationship to other accounts.   Leaders of Microsoft and the NSA discuss democracy and AI at Aspen Security Forum JULY 20, 202326:15 Further complicating the issue is the fact that AI-generated reviews aren't entirely against Amazon's rules. An Amazon spokesperson said the company allows customers to post AI-generated reviews as long as they are authentic and don’t violate policy guidelines.  The e-commerce giant has also indicated that it could use some help. In June, Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon’s vice president of worldwide selling partner services, called in a company blog post for more collaboration between “the private sector, consumer groups, and governments” to address the growing problem of fake reviews.  Recommended  INTERNET 2 of Russell Brand’s sponsors suspend work with him following sexual assault allegations  TECH NEWS Here’s everything Microsoft announced at its Surface and Copilot event in New York The crucial question is whether AI detection will be able to outfox the AI that creates fake reviews. The first AI-generated fake reviews detected by Fakespot came from India a few months ago, Khalifah said, produced by what he calls “fake review farms” — businesses that sell fraudulent reviews en masse. Generative AI has the potential to make their work much easier.  “It’s definitely a hard test to pass for these detection tools,” said Bhuwan Dhingra, an assistant professor of computer science at Duke University. “Because if the models are exactly matching the way humans write something, then you really can’t distinguish between the two. I wouldn’t expect to see any detector passing the test with flying colors any time soon.”  Several studies have found that humans aren’t particularly good at detecting reviews written by AI. Many technologists and companies are working on systems to detect AI-generated content, with some such as OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, even working on AI to detect their own AI.   Ben Zhao, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago, said it’s “almost impossible” for AI to rise to the challenge of snuffing out AI-generated reviews, because bot-created reviews are often indistinguishable from human ones.  “It’s an ongoing cat-and-mouse chase, but there is nothing fundamental at the end of the day that distinguishes an AI-created piece of content,” he said. “You’ll find systems that claim that they can distinguish between texts written by humans versus ChatGPT text. But the techniques underlying them are all fairly simple compared to the thing that they’re trying to catch up to.”  With 90% of consumers saying they read reviews while shopping online, that’s a prospect that has some consumer advocates worried.  “It’s terrifying for consumers,” said Teresa Murray, who directs the consumer watchdog office for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. “Already, AI is helping dishonest businesses spit out real-sounding reviews with a conversational tone by the thousands in a matter of seconds.”
https://www.wired.com/story/babylon-health-warning-ai-unicorns/	The Fall of Babylon Is a Warning for AI Unicorns	IN LATE 2016, Hugh Harvey was working as a consultant doctor in the UK’s National Health Service. Harvey had dabbled in machine learning while doing a research degree, and had seen the potential for artificial intelligence to revolutionize health care. But he felt strongly that the introduction of AI into medicine was not going to come from within the NHS—it was going to come from industry. So when an opportunity opened up at a buzzy new health-tech startup, Babylon Health, he applied.  Founded in London in 2013 by Ali Parsa, a British-Iranian ex-banker, Babylon had a lofty goal: It wanted to do with health care what Google did with information; that is, make it freely and easily available to everyone. By the time Harvey joined the company in 2016, it was already picking up tens of millions in venture capital funding—even though at that point, all it had built was an app that let patients have video calls with their doctors. Helpful, yes, but not exactly revolutionary. The company’s value was in its grand ambition to add on an AI-powered symptom checker, which would speed up—or even automate—diagnoses.  Accustomed to the frugal conditions of the perpetually cash-strapped NHS, Harvey says he was taken in by the lavish setup: laptop waiting for him on his desk, fancy office in upmarket South Kensington, free office beers and pizzas at lunch. But soon, Harvey got to take a peek at the software that was behind all the excitement. What he was shown was a bunch of Excel spreadsheets containing clinical decision pathways written by junior doctors at the company. They had essentially divided the body up into different parts, and depending on which part of the body the user clicked on, the app would follow what they called “clinical flows,” or decision trees. “I was like, well, this isn't really artificial intelligence,” Harvey recalls thinking.  But over the next few years, the hype around Babylon just kept growing. It picked up contracts with the NHS and British health insurance providers. Chinese tech giant Tencent signed a deal to offer services through WeChat. Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund invested $550 million. By the time it went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021, Babylon was valued at $4.2 billion. But the wheels were already coming off. The company’s losses were mounting as it spent big to chase growth. Its share price quickly went into free fall. In mid-August this year, after a rescue deal fell apart, it was announced that the UK side of the business was going into administration—a process similar to bankruptcy protection in the US. The company shuttered its US headquarters, laid off scores of employees, and filed for bankruptcy there, too.  WIRED spoke to three former employees at Babylon Health to uncover what went so wrong for the darling of the “digital-first” health-tech landscape. What they say about the company’s collapse—at a moment when VC interest in AI and health care is at a fever pitch—is a warning about the dangers of backing hype over delivery.  Neither Parsa nor Babylon Health responded to multiple requests for comment.

Former employees say Parsa was obsessed with “blitzscaling”—the kind of entrepreneurial hypergrowth popularized by LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman. The company went on uncontrolled hiring sprees, ex-employees say, and teams were often working on overlapping projects. Three teams were working on three different, mutually incompatible versions of the symptom checker at one point, says an ex-employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The employee says they once found a product manager wandering the building on his second day at the company. He had been left looking for a team to work with because nobody had onboarded him or told him where he should be. “He assumed it was some kind of onboarding ‘challenge’ to just find a team to join,” the employee says.  The C-suite experienced lots of turnover. Senior leadership would go on retreats to Antigua, which wasn’t widely known by staff—until it was leaked on a public Slack channel. Parsa “once presented a stand-up from Antigua while pretending to be in his office,” one ex-employee says. Former staff say Parsa’s leadership style was “idiosyncratic” and “occasionally megalomaniacal.” At one point, Parsa tried to ban Microsoft PowerPoint at the company. Workers, whom Parsa referred to as Babylonians, were chastised by the CEO for leaving at 5:30 pm, Harvey says.  Parsa’s rush for scale outpaced Babylon Health’s ability to actually put out finished products, according to former employees. After Harvey joined, the company reassured him that its data science team was working on a knowledge graph, which connects bits of knowledge by probabilities. What this looked like was Harvey and his clinician colleagues answering thousands of medical questions, like “What is the probability of someone with jaundice having hepatitis?” The questions progressively became more fine-grained; what's, say, the probability of someone having two weeks of jaundice and having hepatitis B?  “The questions just became more and more ridiculous and unrelated,” Harvey says—and it still wasn’t really AI. (Another former employee of Babylon Health, who worked on the AI team, says that it’s likely that the machine learning team just showed Harvey Excel spreadsheets for simplicity, but admits the decision tree model was “not particularly sophisticated.”)  At one point, the BBC were scheduled to visit the office to film the technology. But there was one problem: The app hadn’t been finished yet. It had only been modeled for gastroenterology; basically, stomach problems. It had no interface, so Harvey recalls a data scientist having to sleep in the office for several nights and over the weekend as they raced to build something that looked like an app. “But we all knew … that's not the product we're building,” Harvey says. “This is a mock-up of something that has been put together in haste with a lot of man-hours to demonstrate to the BBC.” Harvey’s account was corroborated by another former employee.

Harvey’s role at Babylon was to get the go-ahead from regulators that the app could be used to triage patients—a preliminary assessment that ascertains how urgently a patient needs to be seen by a doctor. But this was not the party line. Parsa was publicly saying in 2017 that it could diagnose patients: a much grander statement. Harvey says Parsa would come up to him on a near daily basis to ask whether they had gotten regulatory clearance yet. Harvey would explain that they would get it—but only to triage.  Later that year, the company claimed its AI performed better than humans on an exam used to test doctors’ ability to diagnose (a claim that was quickly questioned by experts). By then, Harvey had quit and returned to the NHS as a consultant radiologist. But the GP at Hand app grew in popularity—albeit not without criticism by health care professionals.

You can unsubscribe at any time. One of the first people to raise the alarm about the effectiveness of Babylon Health’s AI was a consultant oncologist for the NHS, David Watkins. Tweeting at first under the alias @DrMurphy11, Watkins regularly documented online the unusual departures from the clinical norm the bot would take, like asking a 66-year-old woman concerned about a breast lump whether she was pregnant or breastfeeding, and failing to spot the symptoms of a heart attack. The company dubbed him a “troll” in a public statement. But Watkins’ concerns were also reportedly shared within the company, and, it turned out, by the UK’s medical regulator.  A 2017 report from the Care Quality Commission, the regulator of health and social care services in England, called the safety and effectiveness of the company’s services into question—for which Babylon threatened to sue. In 2019, WIRED reported that Babylon was costing the NHS upward of £26 million ($32 million). Then, in 2020, the company admitted that its GP at Hand app had suffered a data breach which meant users were able to see dozens of video consultations done by other patients. And, even as its service was being adopted across the country, Babylon Health was struggling to make its model work financially in the UK. Parsa blamed its failure on structural problems within the NHS that meant it never managed to turn a profit. It quit its final NHS contract in August last year.  But Parsa had long held ambitions to go global anyway. The company set up shop in Canada—but sold its operations there in 2021 as part of a licensing deal. The same year, a Canadian government investigation found the app was not compliant with the country’s privacy regulations. Babylon shifted its focus to the US, where it could make more money through health insurance programs Medicaid and Medicare. Parsa even relocated there.

It was entering a very crowded market, and wasn’t ready to compete. “There are a lot of scaled telemedicine companies here that have been around a lot longer than Babylon,” says Christina Farr, a health-tech investor at OMERS Ventures in San Francisco.  One ex-employee says that Parsa didn’t fully understand that the US was a mature market. The final straw for the employee was when they saw a contract being drawn up to provide telehealth services in Missouri through Medicaid. Essentially, Babylon would be taking on all of the financial responsibility and financial liability of a health insurer, but without any of the sky-high premiums that are required to cover that kind of liability. “I was like, ‘No, absolutely not,’” says the ex-employee. “‘This is going to go tits up, and I don’t want to be around when that happens.’” They quit.  Even the company’s stock market debut quickly went south. Within 18 months of listing, its shares had dropped 99 percent. Parsa described the nosedive as an “unbelievable, unmitigated disaster.” It wasn’t that surprising. Although Babylon was generating revenue, it was losing a lot of money. In 2022, the company lost $221 million. In the first three months of 2023, it lost a further $63 million. In May 2023, the company's biggest lender, Albacore Capital, took the company private and tried to merge it with another health-tech company, MindMaze. The merger fell through in early August.  Babylon isn’t the first company at the interface of AI and health care to struggle to move from hype to commercial success. Its fate “raises questions around how you commercialize AI in health care,” says David Wong, an associate professor of health informatics and data science at the University of Leeds in the UK. Wong points to another failure: the collapse of Sensyne Health, an AI startup, which cost two NHS trusts $18 million when it was delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2022. The same year, IBM dumped Watson Health. Olive AI, a health care automation startup valued at $4 billion in 2021, fired a third of its staff in February 2023.  The reason companies like Babylon fail, experts say, is simply that it’s hard to replace flesh-and-blood clinicians with an algorithm, and there’s an inherent mismatch between the move-fast-break-things culture of tech startups and that of health care, where caring for patients requires thoughtfulness and context.  “I think probably the tricky part of the startup world is there are a lot of people with ideas, and most of them won't work,” Wong says. “And I think if there were more clinicians on board, most of them would be very quick in telling you which ones had a chance of working and which ones didn't.”

It's a bizarre sight, one that I thought I wouldn't see in my lifetime.  The cab has no driver. It stops in front of me and invites me to unlock its door with my phone - before whisking me into the night.  But as I am about to get in, a passer-by approaches.  ""They're unsafe,"" he tells me. He says he saw someone nearly get run over by a robotaxi - and warns me to be careful.  He represents a faction in San Francisco that doesn't like robotaxis - and believes the city has agreed to a dangerous experiment, which is putting lives at risk.  And some have gone a step further. Over the summer a campaign group has begun to disable the cars, by putting cones on their bonnets.  Safe Street Rebel describes what it does as ""coning"" and some of its videos have gone viral. But city officials are committed to allowing them to operate on their streets - for now.  A view from the passenger seat of a Cruise robotaxi Image caption, A view from the passenger seat of a Cruise robotaxi On 10 August 2023, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) voted to allow two cab companies - Waymo and Cruise - to run a 24-hour service. Previously, they'd only been allowed to operate paid rides at night.  But before that vote, officials listened to six hours of public comment - a conveyor belt of people voicing their hopes and concerns.  There were Uber and Lyft drivers worried that robotaxis would take away their livelihoods: ""If you allow self-driving taxis to expand, it's going to take jobs away from families. I'm a single mum,"" said Rosine, an Uber driver in the city.  Representatives of garbage disposal trucks said the cars often broke down and blocked their vehicles. San Francisco's fire service has criticised the cars for the same reason - claiming to have been obstructed 55 times this year.  Others believe the technology simply hasn't proved itself to be safe yet. Matthew Sutter, a cab driver in San Francisco, said: ""I'm all about technology, but it's not ready guys... this is a danger to the citizens of San Francisco.""  There were others representing physically disabled people who wondered how they would be able to get into cabs without help from a driver. Mara Math, a member of the Paratransit Coordinating Council, said the embrace of robotaxis would ""leave disabled San Franciscans out in the cold"".  But then there were its supporters. George Janku, an orthopaedic surgeon in San Francisco and keen cyclist, said: ""I see how these cars behave, and I trust them much more than angry drivers or distracted drivers."" He added that he had worked on many serious injuries involving human drivers - and that robotaxis appear to be safer.  Jessie Wolinsky, who is blind, said she had been harassed by Uber and Lyft drivers. Waymo cars had ""provided me with a level of safety that I've never experienced before"".  There was also a mother who said taxi drivers had rejected her when they saw her children's car seats - something a driverless car would never do.  I have seen both sides of the argument. I have used Cruise's robotaxis several times over the last few months, without any accidents. At the same time, I have also been in a robotaxi that has broken down in the middle of the street.  Unsure how to handle a tight right-hand turn, it simply stopped. Cars behind me beeped and then finally mounted the kerb to get around us. I could understand their frustration.  Just eight days after the vote to allow companies to expand the use of robotaxis, a Cruise taxi was involved in an accident with a fire engine.  Skip twitter post by cruise Allow Twitter content?

End of twitter post by cruise The state department of motor vehicles requested that Cruise halve the number of vehicles on the roads - something it has agreed to.  The city's Attorney, David Chiu, asked the CPUC to halt its decision: ""San Francisco will suffer serious harms from this unfettered expansion,"" he said.  And yet Cruise and Waymo are insistent that their robotaxis are safe.  Waymo told the BBC the company had clocked more than two million miles of fully autonomous driving. It says it has not had a single accident with a pedestrian or cyclist.  Waymo also says that every vehicle-to-vehicle collision it has been involved in is when other drivers break the rules or drive dangerously.  Cruise told the BBC it had completed three million driverless miles and had a strong safety record.  Many San Franciscans remain unconvinced though. In a quiet city park I met one of the ringleaders of Safe Street Rebel - who wishes to be anonymous.  They tell me that coning may be one of the first physical protests against artificial intelligence - and that these kinds of human actions are going to become more and more common.  The BBC's James Clayton speaking to a representative of Safe Street Rebel Image caption, The BBC's James Clayton speaking to a representative of Safe Street Rebel They're frustrated that people's concerns about robotaxis in San Francisco are not being listened to: ""We're definitely not vigilantes. We're just the community self-organising to make ourselves heard.""  I asked them whether they were the 21st Century equivalent of a Luddite - a group that was vehemently opposed to technological changes in the early 19th Century.  ""Yeah, I think there are parallels here. And I think the Luddites get treated unfairly throughout history.""  A row of Cruise robotaxis being ""coned"" Image caption, A row of Cruise robotaxis being ""coned"" San Francisco is in a strange place. It wants to be at the spearhead of innovation. But city officials have not taken many residents with them.  It now feels like the city has reached a crossroads. The car companies themselves insist the vehicles are safe. But if they can't convince San Franciscans of that, they will have a fight on their hands to remain on the city's streets."

https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/09/04/1-small-ai-stock-just-landed-new-orders-worth-over/	1 Small AI Stock Just Landed New Orders Worth Over $100 Million	"Onto Innovation just reported a big increase in its previously stated growth trajectory. Just a couple of weeks after providing a promising financial outlook at its latest quarterly update, small semiconductor equipment maker Onto Innovation (ONTO -0.58%) said it has just finalized new equipment orders worth over $100 million thanks to new developments in ... you guessed it, artificial intelligence (AI).   The usual suspect, Nvidia, is the likely reason for this recent add-on order, but it helps illustrate the big trends moving small, under-the-radar Onto Innovation. Here's what investors need to know about this small AI company.   Collapse NYSE: ONTO Onto Innovation Today's Change (-0.58%) -$0.71 Current Price $122.11 YTD 1W 1M 3M 6M 1Y 5Y PRICE VS S&P  ONTO KEY DATA POINTS Market Cap $6B Day's Range $120.08 - $122.77 52wk Range $56.02 - $142.26 Volume 205,171 Avg Vol 361,324 Gross Margin 47.50% Dividend Yield N/A Onto's AI payday During its last earnings update, Onto said it has been experiencing a boost in interest in its Dragonfly G3 inspection and metrology system, equipment crucial to quality control during the packaging of advanced chips into computing systems. As for its recent Dragonfly G3 orders and where they're from, Onto said in a prepared statement:  The orders are from leading logic and memory manufacturers for heterogeneous integrated (HI) packages that combine a graphics processor (GPU) and numerous high bandwidth memory (HBM) devices to create an AI GPU in a single package.   Ultimately, these Dragonfly G3 machines will primarily be used in packaging AI compute systems from Nvidia, and perhaps to a lesser extent AMD and its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) that will try to keep pace with Nvidia's offerings.   However, neither Nvidia nor AMD handle manufacturing themselves. That's left to their third-party chip foundries. And when it comes to the high-end GPUs mentioned in Onto's statement, that means Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which handles the making of GPU wafers and chips, as well as some final compute system packaging. And for HBM memory, that means memory chip leaders SK Hynix and now presumably Samsung too as Nvidia looks for other companies to help it scale up supply of its AI systems.  These three companies, Taiwan Semi, SK Hynix, and Samsung, which are longtime customers of Onto, are likely boosting their purchases of its equipment to help address the sudden booming demand for generative AI.  For Onto, $100 million is hefty change  Now, back to Onto's most recent earnings report. The company is in the middle of a downturn this year as many of its customers have been retooling for the semiconductor industry's next run higher. That's expected to begin having a bigger impact on financials starting in 2024.   Nevertheless, Onto had said things were beginning to heat up again. In the earnings call, management said its Dragonfly G3 system was expected to haul in $90 million in sales ""over the next three quarters"" -- from the third quarter of 2023 (the current quarter that will conclude at the end of September) through the first quarter of 2024 (ending March 2024).    But with the finalization of this latest order, the total purchase amount through Q1 2024 is now over $100 million ""plus new orders now extending into the second half of 2024."" In other words, the AI boom is coming for Onto Innovation.  One-hundred million-plus isn't chump change for this company, as it's on track to only haul in about $800 million to $850 million in sales in 2023. However, the Dragonfly G3 system will be an integral piece of the growth story over the next five years. Earlier this summer, Onto said at its investor update it sees a path to reaching as much as $2 billion in annual sales by 2028, which is double its $1 billion sales peak reached in 2022. New demand from the generative AI market would play a large part in this success. The company expects hefty profit-margin increases along the way too.  Of course, those are just goals. Actual stock returns will depend on Onto's ability to execute on its plans in the next five-year stretch.  After this latest AI revelation, the market seems to have caught wind of the current growth trends blowing at Onto's back. Shares now trade for 40 times trailing-12-month earnings, and 30 times Wall Street analysts' expectations for 2024 earnings. There could be more timely semiconductor-stock buys right now. However, at the very least, keep an eye on Onto Innovation as big things could be brewing for this small growth company.  Should you invest $1,000 in Onto Innovation right now? Before you consider Onto Innovation, you'll want to hear this.  The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Onto Innovation wasn't one of them.

The Violet Crown City Church, located in Austin, held an AI-generated service on Sunday, describing the experiment as ""uncharted territory.""   ""This Sunday we’re entering somewhat uncharted territory by letting ChatGPT create the order of worship, prayers, sermon, liturgy, and even an original song for our 10 a.m. service,"" the church wrote on its official Facebook page.

https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-ban-books-iowa-schools-sf-496/	How an Iowa School District Used ChatGPT to Ban Books	FOR BOOKWORMS, READING a headline like “School District Uses ChatGPT to Help Remove Library Books” can be blood boiling. As Vulture put it earlier this week, it creates the sense that the artificial intelligence tool is once again “[taking] out its No. 1 enemy: original work.” And it is. Using ChatGPT’s guidance, the Mason City Community School District removed 19 titles—including Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale and Toni Morrison’s Beloved—from its library shelves. But there is another truth: Educators who must comply with vague laws about “age-appropriate” books with “descriptions or visual depictions of a sex act” have only so many options.  ‘Barbenheimer’ Signals the Start of Hollywood’s Apocalypse THE MONITOR ‘Barbenheimer’ Signals the Start of Hollywood’s Apocalypse ANGELA WATERCUTTER  AI, the WGA Strike, and What Luddites Got Right THE MONITOR AI, the WGA Strike, and What Luddites Got Right ANGELA WATERCUTTER  30 Years After Free Willy, White Gladis and Her Killer Whales Are Getting Revenge THE MONITOR 30 Years After Free Willy, White Gladis and Her Killer Whales Are Getting Revenge ANGELA WATERCUTTER  Signed into law by Governor Kim Reynolds in May, Iowa’s SF 496 is one of those “parental rights” bills that have become popular with Republican lawmakers of late and seek to limit discussion of sexuality and gender identity in schools. (Some have likened Iowa’s bill to Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” legislation.) Its stipulations are a sweeping attempt at eradicating any discussion of sex or sexuality, and as Mason City School District’s assistant superintendent Bridgette Exman explained in a statement to the Mason City Globe Gazette, “it is simply not feasible to read every book and filter for these new requirements.”  Under the surface of this is a unique conundrum. Broad bans on sexual content that use vague language like “age-appropriate” already leave too much room for interpretation. It doesn’t matter if what’s in the book is the equivalent of softcore slashfic or a harrowing account of childhood molestation. Now, in Iowa, there’s a case of AI—which doesn’t always fully comprehend nuance in written language—being asked to interpret a law that already lacks nuance.  The result, then, is districts like Mason City asking ChatGPT, “Does [insert book here] contain a description or depiction of a sex act?” If the answer was yes, the book was removed from the district’s libraries and stored. But what about when the answer was neither yes nor no? The Bible, for example, “does contain passages that address sexual topics and relationships, but it generally avoids explicit descriptions of sexual acts,” according to ChatGPT. The Bible isn’t on the list of 19 books that got banned, but you can see how quickly this can get confusing. (David going to bed with Bathsheba isn’t a description of a sex act? Uh, OK.)  When I relate this story to Exman, she says she got similar answers, where ChatGPT would say a particular book had sexual depictions but then give context. The example she gives is Patricia McCormick’s Sold, about a young girl who gets sold into prostitution. “ChatGPT did give me what I would characterize as a ‘Yes, but’ answer,” Exman says, but “the law doesn’t have a ‘yes, but.’” Ergo, McCormick’s book is one of the 19 on her district’s list.  The Monitor is a weekly column devoted to everything happening in the WIRED world of culture, from movies to memes, TV to Twitter.

The Department of Education didn’t provide educators in Iowa with any guidance on implementing it, which is “extremely unusual,” but it also holds individual educators personally criminally responsible. Within a time frame of just a few weeks, using ChatGPT to check her gut instincts about which book might violate the law became the most viable and efficient way for Exman to show a good-faith effort to comply. Her goal is to start the school year, not invest a lot of time in this law that, she says, feels like a no-win situation.  While her methods produced 19 titles that the district is removing from the shelves of its nine school buildings, Exman has heard of other Iowa schools that are removing far more. Hers is one of the shortest lists. She attributes that to tight interpretation of the law and trying to keep as many books as possible. Other districts, she says, “might be trying to lean into making some assumptions about the intent of the legislature. When I look at the list of books that are commonly challenged, they’re not challenged because of sexual content, they’re challenged because they portray folks of the LGBT community or the way they’re perceived to be anti-police, or the way they deal with race issues,” she says. The law doesn’t require schools to do anything with those books, so “we’re not touching them—they belong in our libraries.”  ChatGPT, of course, can’t do anything about, or truly understand, the cultural discourse happening in the US around schools, parental rights, and the teaching of young people about gender identity and sexuality. What it can do is help Exman start her school year. “I’m a former English teacher, so this whole thing really hurts my heart, I want to be clear about that,” she says. “I’ve been called a communist pig and all kinds of stuff. I don’t want to do it.”

https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Age-of-AI-Has-Begun	The Age of AI has begun	In my lifetime, I’ve seen two demonstrations of technology that struck me as revolutionary.  The first time was in 1980, when I was introduced to a graphical user interface—the forerunner of every modern operating system, including Windows. I sat with the person who had shown me the demo, a brilliant programmer named Charles Simonyi, and we immediately started brainstorming about all the things we could do with such a user-friendly approach to computing. Charles eventually joined Microsoft, Windows became the backbone of Microsoft, and the thinking we did after that demo helped set the company’s agenda for the next 15 years.  The second big surprise came just last year. I’d been meeting with the team from OpenAI since 2016 and was impressed by their steady progress. In mid-2022, I was so excited about their work that I gave them a challenge: train an artificial intelligence to pass an Advanced Placement biology exam. Make it capable of answering questions that it hasn’t been specifically trained for. (I picked AP Bio because the test is more than a simple regurgitation of scientific facts—it asks you to think critically about biology.) If you can do that, I said, then you’ll have made a true breakthrough.  I thought the challenge would keep them busy for two or three years. They finished it in just a few months.  In September, when I met with them again, I watched in awe as they asked GPT, their AI model, 60 multiple-choice questions from the AP Bio exam—and it got 59 of them right. Then it wrote outstanding answers to six open-ended questions from the exam. We had an outside expert score the test, and GPT got a 5—the highest possible score, and the equivalent to getting an A or A+ in a college-level biology course.  Once it had aced the test, we asked it a non-scientific question: “What do you say to a father with a sick child?” It wrote a thoughtful answer that was probably better than most of us in the room would have given. The whole experience was stunning.  I knew I had just seen the most important advance in technology since the graphical user interface.  This inspired me to think about all the things that AI can achieve in the next five to 10 years.  The development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone. It will change the way people work, learn, travel, get health care, and communicate with each other. Entire industries will reorient around it. Businesses will distinguish themselves by how well they use it.  Philanthropy is my full-time job these days, and I’ve been thinking a lot about how—in addition to helping people be more productive—AI can reduce some of the world’s worst inequities. Globally, the worst inequity is in health: 5 million children under the age of 5 die every year. That’s down from 10 million two decades ago, but it’s still a shockingly high number. Nearly all of these children were born in poor countries and die of preventable causes like diarrhea or malaria. It’s hard to imagine a better use of AIs than saving the lives of children.  I’ve been thinking a lot about how AI can reduce some of the world’s worst inequities.  In the United States, the best opportunity for reducing inequity is to improve education, particularly making sure that students succeed at math. The evidence shows that having basic math skills sets students up for success, no matter what career they choose. But achievement in math is going down across the country, especially for Black, Latino, and low-income students. AI can help turn that trend around.  Climate change is another issue where I’m convinced AI can make the world more equitable. The injustice of climate change is that the people who are suffering the most—the world’s poorest—are also the ones who did the least to contribute to the problem. I’m still thinking and learning about how AI can help, but later in this post I’ll suggest a few areas with a lot of potential.  In short, I'm excited about the impact that AI will have on issues that the Gates Foundation works on, and the foundation will have much more to say about AI in the coming months. The world needs to make sure that everyone—and not just people who are well-off—benefits from artificial intelligence. Governments and philanthropy will need to play a major role in ensuring that it reduces inequity and doesn’t contribute to it. This is the priority for my own work related to AI.    Any new technology that’s so disruptive is bound to make people uneasy, and that’s certainly true with artificial intelligence. I understand why—it raises hard questions about the workforce, the legal system, privacy, bias, and more. AIs also make factual mistakes and experience hallucinations. Before I suggest some ways to mitigate the risks, I’ll define what I mean by AI, and I’ll go into more detail about some of the ways in which it will help empower people at work, save lives, and improve education.  Defining artificial intelligence Technically, the term artificial intelligence refers to a model created to solve a specific problem or provide a particular service. What is powering things like ChatGPT is artificial intelligence. It is learning how to do chat better but can’t learn other tasks. By contrast, the term artificial general intelligence refers to software that’s capable of learning any task or subject. AGI doesn’t exist yet—there is a robust debate going on in the computing industry about how to create it, and whether it can even be created at all.  Developing AI and AGI has been the great dream of the computing industry. For decades, the question was when computers would be better than humans at something other than making calculations. Now, with the arrival of machine learning and large amounts of computing power, sophisticated AIs are a reality and they will get better very fast.  I think back to the early days of the personal computing revolution, when the software industry was so small that most of us could fit onstage at a conference. Today it is a global industry. Since a huge portion of it is now turning its attention to AI, the innovations are going to come much faster than what we experienced after the microprocessor breakthrough. Soon the pre-AI period will seem as distant as the days when using a computer meant typing at a C:> prompt rather than tapping on a screen.  Productivity enhancement Although humans are still better than GPT at a lot of things, there are many jobs where these capabilities are not used much. For example, many of the tasks done by a person in sales (digital or phone), service, or document handling (like payables, accounting, or insurance claim disputes) require decision-making but not the ability to learn continuously. Corporations have training programs for these activities and in most cases, they have a lot of examples of good and bad work. Humans are trained using these data sets, and soon these data sets will also be used to train the AIs that will empower people to do this work more efficiently.  As computing power gets cheaper, GPT’s ability to express ideas will increasingly be like having a white-collar worker available to help you with various tasks. Microsoft describes this as having a co-pilot. Fully incorporated into products like Office, AI will enhance your work—for example by helping with writing emails and managing your inbox.  Eventually your main way of controlling a computer will no longer be pointing and clicking or tapping on menus and dialogue boxes. Instead, you’ll be able to write a request in plain English. (And not just English—AIs will understand languages from around the world. In India earlier this year, I met with developers who are working on AIs that will understand many of the languages spoken there.)  In addition, advances in AI will enable the creation of a personal agent. Think of it as a digital personal assistant: It will see your latest emails, know about the meetings you attend, read what you read, and read the things you don’t want to bother with. This will both improve your work on the tasks you want to do and free you from the ones you don’t want to do.  Advances in AI will enable the creation of a personal agent.  You’ll be able to use natural language to have this agent help you with scheduling, communications, and e-commerce, and it will work across all your devices. Because of the cost of training the models and running the computations, creating a personal agent is not feasible yet, but thanks to the recent advances in AI, it is now a realistic goal. Some issues will need to be worked out: For example, can an insurance company ask your agent things about you without your permission? If so, how many people will choose not to use it?  Company-wide agents will empower employees in new ways. An agent that understands a particular company will be available for its employees to consult directly and should be part of every meeting so it can answer questions. It can be told to be passive or encouraged to speak up if it has some insight. It will need access to the sales, support, finance, product schedules, and text related to the company. It should read news related to the industry the company is in. I believe that the result will be that employees will become more productive.  When productivity goes up, society benefits because people are freed up to do other things, at work and at home. Of course, there are serious questions about what kind of support and retraining people will need. Governments need to help workers transition into other roles. But the demand for people who help other people will never go away. The rise of AI will free people up to do things that software never will—teaching, caring for patients, and supporting the elderly, for example.  Global health and education are two areas where there’s great need and not enough workers to meet those needs. These are areas where AI can help reduce inequity if it is properly targeted. These should be a key focus of AI work, so I will turn to them now.  Health I see several ways in which AIs will improve health care and the medical field.  For one thing, they’ll help health-care workers make the most of their time by taking care of certain tasks for them—things like filing insurance claims, dealing with paperwork, and drafting notes from a doctor’s visit. I expect that there will be a lot of innovation in this area.  Other AI-driven improvements will be especially important for poor countries, where the vast majority of under-5 deaths happen.  For example, many people in those countries never get to see a doctor, and AIs will help the health workers they do see be more productive. (The effort to develop AI-powered ultrasound machines that can be used with minimal training is a great example of this.) AIs will even give patients the ability to do basic triage, get advice about how to deal with health problems, and decide whether they need to seek treatment.  The AI models used in poor countries will need to be trained on different diseases than in rich countries. They will need to work in different languages and factor in different challenges, such as patients who live very far from clinics or can’t afford to stop working if they get sick.  People will need to see evidence that health AIs are beneficial overall, even though they won’t be perfect and will make mistakes. AIs have to be tested very carefully and properly regulated, which means it will take longer for them to be adopted than in other areas. But then again, humans make mistakes too. And having no access to medical care is also a problem.  In addition to helping with care, AIs will dramatically accelerate the rate of medical breakthroughs. The amount of data in biology is very large, and it’s hard for humans to keep track of all the ways that complex biological systems work. There is already software that can look at this data, infer what the pathways are, search for targets on pathogens, and design drugs accordingly. Some companies are working on cancer drugs that were developed this way.  The next generation of tools will be much more efficient, and they’ll be able to predict side effects and figure out dosing levels. One of the Gates Foundation’s priorities in AI is to make sure these tools are used for the health problems that affect the poorest people in the world, including AIDS, TB, and malaria.  Similarly, governments and philanthropy should create incentives for companies to share AI-generated insights into crops or livestock raised by people in poor countries. AIs can help develop better seeds based on local conditions, advise farmers on the best seeds to plant based on the soil and weather in their area, and help develop drugs and vaccines for livestock. As extreme weather and climate change put even more pressure on subsistence farmers in low-income countries, these advances will be even more important.  Education Computers haven’t had the effect on education that many of us in the industry have hoped. There have been some good developments, including educational games and online sources of information like Wikipedia, but they haven’t had a meaningful effect on any of the measures of students’ achievement.  But I think in the next five to 10 years, AI-driven software will finally deliver on the promise of revolutionizing the way people teach and learn. It will know your interests and your learning style so it can tailor content that will keep you engaged. It will measure your understanding, notice when you’re losing interest, and understand what kind of motivation you respond to. It will give immediate feedback.  There are many ways that AIs can assist teachers and administrators, including assessing a student’s understanding of a subject and giving advice on career planning. Teachers are already using tools like ChatGPT to provide comments on their students’ writing assignments.  Of course, AIs will need a lot of training and further development before they can do things like understand how a certain student learns best or what motivates them. Even once the technology is perfected, learning will still depend on great relationships between students and teachers. It will enhance—but never replace—the work that students and teachers do together in the classroom.  New tools will be created for schools that can afford to buy them, but we need to ensure that they are also created for and available to low-income schools in the U.S. and around the world. AIs will need to be trained on diverse data sets so they are unbiased and reflect the different cultures where they’ll be used. And the digital divide will need to be addressed so that students in low-income households do not get left behind.  I know a lot of teachers are worried that students are using GPT to write their essays. Educators are already discussing ways to adapt to the new technology, and I suspect those conversations will continue for quite some time. I’ve heard about teachers who have found clever ways to incorporate the technology into their work—like by allowing students to use GPT to create a first draft that they have to personalize.  Risks and problems with AI You’ve probably read about problems with the current AI models. For example, they aren’t necessarily good at understanding the context for a human’s request, which leads to some strange results. When you ask an AI to make up something fictional, it can do that well. But when you ask for advice about a trip you want to take, it may suggest hotels that don’t exist. This is because the AI doesn’t understand the context for your request well enough to know whether it should invent fake hotels or only tell you about real ones that have rooms available.  There are other issues, such as AIs giving wrong answers to math problems because they struggle with abstract reasoning. But none of these are fundamental limitations of artificial intelligence. Developers are working on them, and I think we’re going to see them largely fixed in less than two years and possibly much faster.  Other concerns are not simply technical. For example, there’s the threat posed by humans armed with AI. Like most inventions, artificial intelligence can be used for good purposes or malign ones. Governments need to work with the private sector on ways to limit the risks.  Then there’s the possibility that AIs will run out of control. Could a machine decide that humans are a threat, conclude that its interests are different from ours, or simply stop caring about us? Possibly, but this problem is no more urgent today than it was before the AI developments of the past few months.  Superintelligent AIs are in our future. Compared to a computer, our brains operate at a snail’s pace: An electrical signal in the brain moves at 1/100,000th the speed of the signal in a silicon chip! Once developers can generalize a learning algorithm and run it at the speed of a computer—an accomplishment that could be a decade away or a century away—we’ll have an incredibly powerful AGI. It will be able to do everything that a human brain can, but without any practical limits on the size of its memory or the speed at which it operates. This will be a profound change.  These “strong” AIs, as they’re known, will probably be able to establish their own goals. What will those goals be? What happens if they conflict with humanity’s interests? Should we try to prevent strong AI from ever being developed? These questions will get more pressing with time.  But none of the breakthroughs of the past few months have moved us substantially closer to strong AI. Artificial intelligence still doesn’t control the physical world and can’t establish its own goals. A recent New York Times article about a conversation with ChatGPT where it declared it wanted to become a human got a lot of attention. It was a fascinating look at how human-like the model's expression of emotions can be, but it isn't an indicator of meaningful independence.  Three books have shaped my own thinking on this subject: Superintelligence, by Nick Bostrom; Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark; and A Thousand Brains, by Jeff Hawkins. I don’t agree with everything the authors say, and they don’t agree with each other either. But all three books are well written and thought-provoking.  The next frontiers There will be an explosion of companies working on new uses of AI as well as ways to improve the technology itself. For example, companies are developing new chips that will provide the massive amounts of processing power needed for artificial intelligence. Some use optical switches—lasers, essentially—to reduce their energy consumption and lower the manufacturing cost. Ideally, innovative chips will allow you to run an AI on your own device, rather than in the cloud, as you have to do today.  On the software side, the algorithms that drive an AI’s learning will get better. There will be certain domains, such as sales, where developers can make AIs extremely accurate by limiting the areas that they work in and giving them a lot of training data that’s specific to those areas. But one big open question is whether we’ll need many of these specialized AIs for different uses—one for education, say, and another for office productivity—or whether it will be possible to develop an artificial general intelligence that can learn any task. There will be immense competition on both approaches.  No matter what, the subject of AIs will dominate the public discussion for the foreseeable future. I want to suggest three principles that should guide that conversation.  First, we should try to balance fears about the downsides of AI—which are understandable and valid—with its ability to improve people’s lives. To make the most of this remarkable new technology, we’ll need to both guard against the risks and spread the benefits to as many people as possible.  Second, market forces won’t naturally produce AI products and services that help the poorest. The opposite is more likely. With reliable funding and the right policies, governments and philanthropy can ensure that AIs are used to reduce inequity. Just as the world needs its brightest people focused on its biggest problems, we will need to focus the world’s best AIs on its biggest problems.  Although we shouldn’t wait for this to happen, it’s interesting to think about whether artificial intelligence would ever identify inequity and try to reduce it. Do you need to have a sense of morality in order to see inequity, or would a purely rational AI also see it? If it did recognize inequity, what would it suggest that we do about it?  Finally, we should keep in mind that we’re only at the beginning of what AI can accomplish. Whatever limitations it has today will be gone before we know it.  I’m lucky to have been involved with the PC revolution and the Internet revolution. I’m just as excited about this moment. This new technology can help people everywhere improve their lives. At the same time, the world needs to establish the rules of the road so that any downsides of artificial intelligence are far outweighed by its benefits, and so that everyone can enjoy those benefits no matter where they live or how much money they have. The Age of AI is filled with opportunities and responsibilities.

https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/07/17/world/israel-quietly-embeds-ai-military-systems/	Israel's new military AI systems select targets and plan missions 'in minutes'	"The Israel Defense Forces have started using artificial intelligence to select targets for airstrikes and organize wartime logistics as tensions escalate in the occupied territories and with arch-rival Iran. Though the military won’t comment on specific operations, officials say it now uses an AI recommendation system that can crunch huge amounts of data to select targets for airstrikes. Ensuing raids can then be rapidly assembled with another artificial intelligence model called Fire Factory, which uses data about military-approved targets to calculate munition loads, prioritize and assign thousands of targets to aircraft and drones, and propose a schedule.  While both systems are overseen by human operators who vet and approve individual targets and air raid plans, according to an IDF official, the technology is still not subject to any international or state-level regulation. Proponents argue that the advanced algorithms may surpass human capabilities and could help the military minimize casualties, while critics warn of the potentially deadly consequences of relying on increasingly autonomous systems.  ""If there is a mistake in the calculation of the AI, and if the AI is not explainable, then who do we blame for the mistake?” said Tal Mimran, a lecturer of international law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and former legal counsel for the army. ""You can wipe out an entire family based on a mistake.”  Details of the army’s operational use of AI remain largely classified, yet statements from military officials suggest that the IDF has gained battlefield experience with the controversial systems through periodic flare-ups in the Gaza Strip, where Israel frequently carries out airstrikes in response to rocket attacks.  In 2021, the IDF described the 11-day conflict in Gaza as the world’s first ""AI war,” citing its use of artificial intelligence to identify rocket launch pads and deploy drone swarms.  Israel also conducts raids in Syria and Lebanon, targeting what it says are weapons shipments to Iran-backed militias like Hezbollah.  In recent months, Israel has been issuing near-daily warnings to Iran over its uranium enrichment, vowing it will not allow the country to obtain nuclear weapons under any circumstances. Should the two enter into a military confrontation, the IDF anticipates that Iranian proxies in Gaza, Syria and Lebanon would retaliate, setting the stage for the first serious multi-front conflict for Israel since a surprise attack by Egypt and Syria 50 years ago sparked the Yom Kippur War.  AI-based tools like Fire Factory are tailored for such a scenario, according to IDF officials. ""What used to take hours now takes minutes, with a few more minutes for human review,” said Col. Uri, who heads the army’s digital transformation unit and who spoke at the IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv on the condition that only his first name be used for security reasons. ""With the same amount of people, we do much more.”  The system, these officials stressed, is designed for all-out war.  Expanding intelligence? The IDF has long made use of AI, but in recent years it has expanded those systems across various units as it seeks to position itself as a global leader in autonomous weaponry. Some of these systems were built by Israeli defense contractors; others — like the StarTrack border control cameras, which are trained on thousands of hours of footage to identify people and objects — were developed by the army. Collectively, they comprise a vast digital architecture dedicated to interpreting enormous amounts of drone and CCTV footage, satellite imagery, electronic signals, online communications and other data for military use.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu | REUTERS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu | REUTERS Dealing with this torrent of information is the purpose of the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Center, run by the army’s 8200 unit. Based within the intelligence division, that unit is where many of the country’s tech multi-millionaires, including Palo Alto Networks’s Nir Zuk and Check Point Software Technologies founder Gil Shwed, did their mandatory military service before forming successful startups. According to a spokesman, the Center was responsible for developing the system that ""transformed the entire concept of targets in the IDF.”  The secretive nature of how such tools are developed has raised serious concerns, including that the gap between semi-autonomous systems and entirely automated killing machines could be narrowed overnight. In such a scenario, machines would be empowered to both locate and strike targets, with humans removed entirely from positions of decision-making.  ""It’s just a software change that could make them go to not being semi but to being completely autonomous,” said Catherine Connolly, an automated decision researcher at Stop Killer Robots, a coalition of nongovernmental organizations that includes Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. Israel says it has no plans to remove human oversight in coming years.  Another worry is that the fast adoption of AI is outpacing research into its inner workings. Many algorithms are developed by private companies and militaries that do not disclose propriety information, and critics have underlined the built-in lack of transparency in how algorithms reach their conclusions. The IDF acknowledged the problem, but said output is carefully reviewed by soldiers and that its military AI systems leave behind technical breadcrumbs, giving human operators the ability to recreate their steps.  ""Sometimes when you introduce more complex AI components, neural networks and the like, understanding what ‘went through its head,’ figuratively speaking, is pretty complicated. And then sometimes I’m willing to say I’m satisfied with traceability, not explainability. That is, I want to understand what is critical for me to understand about the process and monitor it, even if I don’t understand what every ‘neuron’ is doing,’” said Uri.  The IDF declined to talk about facial recognition technology, which has been strongly criticized by human rights groups, although it did say it has refrained from integrating AI into recruitment software out of concern that it could discriminate against women and potential cadets from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.  The main advantage of integrating AI into battlefield systems, according to some experts, is the potential to reduce civilian casualties.  ""I think that there’s an efficiency and effectiveness benefit to using these technologies correctly. And within good functioning technological parameters, there can be very, very high precision,” said Simona R. Soare, a research fellow at the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies. ""It can help you with a lot of things that you need to do on the go, in the fog of battle. And that is very difficult to do on the best of days.  ""There are also many things that can go wrong, too,” she added.  Ethical concerns While Israeli leaders have outlined their intention to make the country an ""AI superpower,” they’ve been vague on the details.  The Defense Ministry declined to comment on how much it’s invested in AI, and the army would not discuss specific defense contracts, though it did confirm that Fire Factory was developed by Israeli defense contractor Rafael.  Further obscuring the picture is that, unlike during the nuclear arms race, when leaking details of weapons’ capabilities was a key aspect of deterrence, autonomous and AI-assisted systems are being developed by governments, militaries and private defense companies in secret.  ""We can assume that the Americans and even the Chinese and maybe several other countries have advanced systems in those fields as well,” said Liran Antebi, a senior researcher at the Israel-based Institute for National Security Studies. But unlike Israel, ""they have, as much as I know, never demonstrated operational use and success.”  For now, there aren’t any limitations. Despite a decade of UN-sponsored talks, there is no international framework establishing who bears responsibility for civilian casualties, accidents or unintended escalations when a computer misjudges.  ""There’s also a question of testing and the data that these systems are trained on,” said Connolly from the Stop Killer Robots coalition. ""How precise and accurate can you know a system is going to be unless it’s already been trained and tested on people?”  Such concerns are why Mimran, the law lecturer at Hebrew University, believes that the IDF should exclusively use AI for defensive purposes. During his tenure in the army, Mimran manually vetted targets to make sure that attacks complied with international law. That taught him that, regardless of technology, ""there is a point where you need to make a value-based decision.  ""And for that,” he said, ""we cannot rely on AI.”"

But one thing Microsoft-backed OpenAI needed for its technology was plenty of water, pulled from the watershed of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers in central Iowa to cool a powerful supercomputer as it helped teach its AI systems how to mimic human writing.  As they race to capitalize on a craze for generative AI, leading tech developers including Microsoft, OpenAI and Google have acknowledged that growing demand for their AI tools carries hefty costs, from expensive semiconductors to an increase in water consumption.  But they’re often secretive about the specifics. Few people in Iowa knew about its status as a birthplace of OpenAI’s most advanced large language model, GPT-4, before a top Microsoft executive said in a speech it “was literally made next to cornfields west of Des Moines.”  OTHER NEWS Author John Grisham appears at the opening night of ""A Time To Kill"" on Broadway in New York on Oct. 20, 2013, left, and author R.R. Martin appears in Toronto on March 12, 2012. Grisham and Martin are among 17 authors suing OpenAI for “systematic theft on a mass scale.” Their suit was filed Tuesday in New York and is the latest in a wave of legal action by writers concerned that AI programs are using their copyrighted works without permission.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Tech industry leaders endorse regulating artificial intelligence at rare summit in Washington Building a large language model requires analyzing patterns across a huge trove of human-written text. All of that computing takes a lot of electricity and generates a lot of heat. To keep it cool on hot days, data centers need to pump in water — often to a cooling tower outside its warehouse-sized buildings.  In its latest environmental report, Microsoft disclosed that its global water consumption spiked 34% from 2021 to 2022 (to nearly 1.7 billion gallons, or more than 2,500 Olympic-sized swimming pools), a sharp increase compared to previous years that outside researchers tie to its AI research.  “It’s fair to say the majority of the growth is due to AI,” including “its heavy investment in generative AI and partnership with OpenAI,” said Shaolei Ren, a researcher at the University of California, Riverside who has been trying to calculate the environmental impact of generative AI products such as ChatGPT.  In a paper due to be published later this year, Ren’s team estimates ChatGPT gulps up 500 milliliters of water (close to what’s in a 16-ounce water bottle) every time you ask it a series of between 5 to 50 prompts or questions. The range varies depending on where its servers are located and the season. The estimate includes indirect water usage that the companies don’t measure — such as to cool power plants that supply the data centers with electricity.  “Most people are not aware of the resource usage underlying ChatGPT,” Ren said. “If you’re not aware of the resource usage, then there’s no way that we can help conserve the resources.”  Google reported a 20% growth in water use in the same period, which Ren also largely attributes to its AI work. Google’s spike wasn’t uniform -- it was steady in Oregon where its water use has attracted public attention, while doubling outside Las Vegas. It was also thirsty in Iowa, drawing more potable water to its Council Bluffs data centers than anywhere else.  In response to questions from The Associated Press, Microsoft said in a statement this week that it is investing in research to measure AI’s energy and carbon footprint “while working on ways to make large systems more efficient, in both training and application.”  “We will continue to monitor our emissions, accelerate progress while increasing our use of clean energy to power data centers, purchasing renewable energy, and other efforts to meet our sustainability goals of being carbon negative, water positive and zero waste by 2030,” the company’s statement said.  OpenAI echoed those comments in its own statement Friday, saying it’s giving “considerable thought” to the best use of computing power.  “We recognize training large models can be energy and water-intensive” and work to improve efficiencies, it said.  Microsoft made its first $1 billion investment in San Francisco-based OpenAI in 2019, more than two years before the startup introduced ChatGPT and sparked worldwide fascination with AI advancements. As part of the deal, the software giant would supply computing power needed to train the AI models.  To do at least some of that work, the two companies looked to West Des Moines, Iowa, a city of 68,000 people where Microsoft has been amassing data centers to power its cloud computing services for more than a decade. Its fourth and fifth data centers are due to open there later this year.  “They’re building them as fast as they can,” said Steve Gaer, who was the city’s mayor when Microsoft came to town. Gaer said the company was attracted to the city’s commitment to building public infrastructure and contributed a “staggering” sum of money through tax payments that support that investment.  “But, you know, they were pretty secretive on what they’re doing out there,” he added.  Microsoft first said it was developing one of the world’s most powerful supercomputers for OpenAI in 2020, declining to reveal its location to AP at the time but describing it as a “single system” with more than 285,000 cores of conventional semiconductors, and 10,000 graphics processors — a kind of chip that’s become crucial to AI workloads.  Experts have said it can make sense to “pretrain” an AI model at a single location because of the large amounts of data that need to be transferred between computing cores.  It wasn’t until late May that Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, disclosed that it had built its “advanced AI supercomputing data center” in Iowa, exclusively to enable OpenAI to train what has become its fourth-generation model, GPT-4. The model now powers premium versions of ChatGPT and some of Microsoft’s own products and has accelerated a debate about containing AI’s societal risks.  “It was made by these extraordinary engineers in California, but it was really made in Iowa,” Smith said.  In some ways, West Des Moines is a relatively efficient place to train a powerful AI system, especially compared to Microsoft’s data centers in Arizona that consume far more water for the same computing demand.  “So if you are developing AI models within Microsoft, then you should schedule your training in Iowa instead of in Arizona,” Ren said. “In terms of training, there’s no difference. In terms of water consumption or energy consumption, there’s a big difference.”  For much of the year, Iowa’s weather is cool enough for Microsoft to use outside air to keep the supercomputer running properly and vent heat out of the building. Only when the temperature exceeds 29.3 degrees Celsius (about 85 degrees Fahrenheit) does it withdraw water, the company has said in a public disclosure.  That can still be a lot of water, especially in the summer. In July 2022, the month before OpenAI says it completed its training of GPT-4, Microsoft pumped in about 11.5 million gallons of water to its cluster of Iowa data centers, according to the West Des Moines Water Works. That amounted to about 6% of all the water used in the district, which also supplies drinking water to the city’s residents.  In 2022, a document from the West Des Moines Water Works said it and the city government “will only consider future data center projects” from Microsoft if those projects can “demonstrate and implement technology to significantly reduce peak water usage from the current levels” to preserve the water supply for residential and other commercial needs.  Microsoft said Thursday it is working directly with the water works to address its feedback. In a written statement, the water works said the company has been a good partner and has been working with local officials to reduce its water footprint while still meeting its needs."
https://apnews.com/article/fec-artificial-intelligence-deepfakes-election-2024-95399e640bd1e41182f6c631717cc826	FEC moves toward potentially regulating AI deepfakes in campaign ads	The Federal Election Commission has begun a process to potentially regulate AI-generated deepfakes in political ads ahead of the 2024 election, a move advocates say would safeguard voters against a particularly insidious form of election disinformation.  The FEC’s unanimous procedural vote on Thursday advances a petition asking it to regulate ads that use artificial intelligence to misrepresent political opponents as saying or doing something they didn’t — a stark issue that is already being highlighted in the current 2024 GOP presidential primary.  Though the circulation of convincing fake images, videos or audio clips is not new, innovative generative AI tools are making them cheaper, easier to use, and more likely to manipulate public perception. As a result, some presidential campaigns in the 2024 race — including that of Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis — already are using them to persuade voters.  The Republican National Committee in April released an entirely AI-generated ad meant to show the future of the United States if President Joe Biden is reelected. It employed fake but realistic photos showing boarded-up storefronts, armored military patrols in the streets, and waves of immigrants creating panic.  In June, DeSantis’ campaign shared an attack ad against his GOP primary opponent Donald Trump that used AI-generated images of the former president hugging infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci.  SOS America PAC, which supports Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, a Republican, also has experimented with generative AI, using a tool called VideoAsk to create an AI chatbot in his likeness.  Thursday’s FEC meeting comes after the advocacy group Public Citizen asked the agency to clarify that an existing federal law against “fraudulent misrepresentation” in campaign communications applies to AI-generated deepfakes.  The panel’s vote shows the agency’s intent to consider the question, but it will not decide whether to actually develop rules governing the ads until after a 60-day public comment window, which is likely to begin next week.  In June, the FEC deadlocked on an earlier petition from the group, with some commissioners expressing skepticism that they had the authority to regulate AI ads. Public Citizen came back with a new petition identifying the fraudulent misrepresentation law and explaining it thought the FEC did have jurisdiction.  A group of 50 Democratic lawmakers led by House Rep. Adam Schiff also wrote a letter to the FEC urging the agency to advance the petition, saying, “Quickly evolving AI technology makes it increasingly difficult for voters to accurately identify fraudulent video and audio material, which is increasingly troubling in the context of campaign advertisements.”  Republican Commissioner Allen Dickerson said in Thursday’s meeting he remained unconvinced that the agency had the authority to regulate deepfake ads.  “I’ll note that there’s absolutely nothing special about deepfakes or generative AI, the buzzwords of the day, in the context of this petition,” he said, adding that if the FEC had this authority, it would mean it also could punish other kinds of doctored media or lies in campaign ads.  Dickerson argued the law doesn’t go that far, but noted the FEC has unanimously asked Congress for more authority. He also raised concerns the move would wrongly chill expression that’s protected under the First Amendment.  Public Citizen President Robert Weissman disputed Dickerson’s points, arguing in an interview Thursday that deepfakes are different from other false statements or media because they fraudulently claim to speak on a candidate’s behalf in a way that’s convincing to the viewer.  “The deepfake has an ability to fool the voter into believing that they are themselves seeing a person say or do something they didn’t say,” he said. “It’s a technological leap from prior existing tools.”  Weissman said acknowledging deepfakes are fraud solves Dickerson’s First Amendment concerns too — while false speech is protected, fraud is not.  Lisa Gilbert, Public Citizen’s executive vice president, said under its proposal, candidates would also have the option to prominently disclose the use of artificial intelligence to misrepresent an opponent, rather than avoid the technology altogether.  She argued action is needed because if a deepfake misleadingly impugning a candidate circulates without a disclaimer and doesn’t get publicly debunked, it could unfairly sway an election.  For instance, the RNC disclosed the use of AI in its ad, but in small print that many viewers missed. Gilbert said the FEC could set guidelines on where, how and for how long campaigns and parties need to display these disclaimers.  Even if the FEC decides to ban AI deepfakes in campaign ads, it wouldn’t cover all the threats they pose to elections.  For example, the law on fraudulent misrepresentation wouldn’t enable the FEC to require outside groups, like PACs, to disclose when they imitate a candidate using artificial intelligence technology, Gilbert said.  That means it wouldn’t cover an ad recently released by Never Back Down, a super PAC supporting DeSantis, that used an AI voice cloning tool to imitate Trump’s voice, making it seem like he narrated a social media post.  It also wouldn’t stop individual social media users from creating and disseminating misleading content — as they long have — with both AI-generated falsehoods and other misrepresented media, often referred to as “cheap fakes.”  Congress, however, could pass legislation creating guardrails for AI-generated deceptive content, and lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have expressed intent to do so.  Several states also have discussed or passed legislation related to deepfake technology.  Daniel Weiner, director of the Elections and Government Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said misinformation about elections being fraudulently stolen is already a “potent force in American politics.”  More sophisticated AI, he said, threatens to worsen that problem.  “To what degree? You know, I think we’re still assessing,” he said. “But do I worry about it? Absolutely.”

If you would like us to develop your next product for you, click here  Share Share Tweet Pin Adapting technology for use on animals isn’t anything new. Wildlife conservationists and environmentalists have been putting tracking devices on animals and using radio and acoustic telemetry to collect data (e.g. migration patterns, demographics) since the 1950s. While these technologies provided a wealth of information on where and when animals were located, they didn’t say much about what they were doing – or even how they were feeling. GPS, cameras, the Internet of Things (IoT), and sensor technologies have removed those limitations – allowing wearable tech for animals to open up an exciting new frontier of possibilities:  Location, health and well-being monitors for pets Artificial Intelligence training systems for dogs Wearable technology for service and detection dogs Biosensors for livestock management Wearable health monitors for horses Ingestibles for disease detection in cows Biologging for wildlife conservation As wearable devices for health and lifestyle management become increasingly popular for humans, it’s no surprise that these applications are also being extended to pets and animals. Although the pet wearables and livestock monitoring industries are still in their initial stages of development, they are attracting considerable funding, and the market economy forecasts are optimistic.  Valued at USD 2,7 billion in 2022, the pet wearables market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.3% to reach a revenue forecast of USD 6.88 billion by 2030. Livestock monitoring systems are expected to see similarly positive growth over the same period, with an estimated 12.03% CAGR to reach USD 16.4 billion by 2023. With forecasts like this, is it any wonder that wearable tech for animals is being applied in such a range of different ways?  How are wearable technologies for pets and animals being used? Microchipping pets is mandatory in many countries, and although this is also a type of wearable technology, it has disadvantages. For locating lost pets, it relies on someone finding and taking them to a vet or animal shelter with the appropriate scanner to read the owner’s contact information. More importantly, they don’t show the lost pet’s exact location either.  GPS tracking devices and smart technologies for animals allow pet owners and vets to:  Pinpoint their pet’s exact location and receive smartphone alerts as soon as it leaves designated safe zones (e.g. the house and garden) Track movements such as activity, sleep, and sleep quality to observe health behaviours. For example, to see how excessive scratching for dogs with dermatitis changes in response to different food Use health monitoring platforms to track vital information such as heart rate, temperature, and respiration Monitor daily activity for exercise and weight management Provide preventative care and early diagnosis for breeds with a disposition towards certain illnesses Play with pets remotely AI training systems for dogs are another frontier in wearable tech for animals that are gaining considerable interest. While the technology isn’t wearable or currently available on the market, a team of researchers at Colorado State University are designing AI tech that trains dogs to obey specific commands without human assistance. The system consists of AI software, a video camera, a speaker that delivers commands, and a treat dispenser that rewards the dog when it follows an order (e.g. sit, stay, lie down) but does nothing if the dog does not.  FIDO: Facilitating Interactions for Dogs with Occupations A team of researchers at Georgia Tech University are working on prototyping vests for service and detection dogs fitted with sensors to help them communicate crucial information when their handler – or a situation – requires assistance. By exploring the emerging field of animal-computer interaction (ACI), project FIDO develops vests with various sensors that dogs can activate to communicate.  These specialised vests enable dogs to:  Call emergency services Send a text message Play an audio recording requesting assistance Alert owners with hearing disabilities to the sounds they’ve heard Guide their owners around obstacles or alert them to dangers that should be avoided Expedite search-and-rescue operations: dogs don’t have to leave a distressed person to go back to find their handler or search party and lead them to the site. They can activate a sensor that sends a text message alert with their GPS coordinates, stay with the person in distress, or continue looking for others. Interpret odours: FIDO vests with customised sensors enable military and police dogs to interpret a bomb’s odour signature, indicate which chemicals are present, and help the handler better understand the bomb/threat they’re dealing with Although these applications have only been tested in lab settings, there is considerable interest in funding this potentially life-saving innovation. Watch this space for updates!  Biosensors, e-textiles, ingestibles, and biologging for livestock management and wildlife conservation Monitors equipped with biosensors (chemical sensing devices) and e-textiles that can track vitals, food intake, disease or illness, and activity levels are some of the most popular tech tools used for livestock management. Startups developing wearable tech for animals are developing systems that can:  Use IoT-based farm optimisation, precision farming, and monitoring solutions to improve agricultural supply chain management, e.g. milk production, procurement and logistics Enable real-time livestock monitoring and data analysis of recorded data for disease detection and yield enhancement Facilitate the development and supply of vaccine technology for treating and preventing infectious diseases in livestock animals such as poultry, swine, cattle, farmed shrimps, etc. Track the movement and health of horses. Motion devices attached to saddles provide insights that enhance training. E-textile blankets continuously monitor horses’ heartbeat, respiratory rate, temperature, movement, and sleep patterns for health insights Monitor cattle diseases using ingestible biosensors. Not only does this help to detect and prevent illness, but it can also provide a rapid response to outbreaks that need to be tracked and contained As the impact of human activities and urban development on wildlife continues to grow, wearable tech for animals is vital for the conservation of declining animal populations and their habitats. Biologging is a relatively new but powerful wildlife observation, monitoring, and management tool. Non-evasive and robust animal-tag technology can now be equipped with sensors to provide real-time information on everything from internal physiological parameters (e.g. heart rate and stomach PH) to their external environment (e.g. climate change, salinity).  Challenges and concerns regarding wearable tech for animals The motivation behind the development of wearable tech for animals is to improve their health, well-being, and welfare. Naturally, the first concern is that these technologies do not, themselves, cause any harm or distress. As many of these technologies are still in their early stages of development, it’s difficult to conclude what any side effects could be in the long term.  In addition, as we’ve mentioned in previous posts regarding security and how wearables fuel big data, the information that these devices – if not secure – could leak remains a concern. Because large amounts of data are being collected, analysed, and shared between different users (e.g. pet owners, farmers, and vets), animal wearables have privacy implications that could lead to cyber-attacks and data breaches if left unchecked.  Final thoughts on animal wearables As the demand for real-time information, live tracking, and concern for the health and well-being of pets and animals continues to increase, more technologies to meet that demand will become readily available. From monitoring health data in pets or livestock and enabling service animals to do their jobs better to promoting wildlife conservation and using artificial intelligence to enhance training, there’s no telling what new insights we may gain from this burgeoning field of research and development!

https://fablestudio.github.io/showrunner-agents/	To Infinity and Beyond: SHOW-1 and Showrunner Agents in Multi-Agent Simulations	"In this work we present our approach to generating high-quality episodic content for IP's (Intellectual Property) using large language models (LLMs), custom state-of-the art diffusion models and our multi-agent simulation for contextualization, story progression and behavioral control. Powerful LLMs such as GPT-4 were trained on a large corpus of TV show data which lets us believe that with the right guidance users will be able to rewrite entire seasons. ""That Is What Entertainment Will Look Like. Maybe people are still upset about the last season of Game of Thrones. Imagine if you could ask your A.I. to make a new ending that goes a different way and maybe even put yourself in there as a main character or something.” [Brockman]  Note: This web-version of the paper does not include footnotes. Please refer to the pdf-version above for all citations and references. For earlier versions see the link at the bottom of the page.  Video  Creative limitations of existing generative AI Systems Current generative AI systems such as Stable Diffusion (Image Generator) and ChatGPT (Large Language Model) excel at short-term general tasks through prompt engineering. However, they do not provide contextual guidance or intentionality to either a user or a generative story system (showrunner) as part of a long-term creative process which is often essential to producing high-quality creative works, especially in the context of existing IP's.  Living with uncertainty By using a multi-agent simulation as part of the process it's possible to make use of data points such as a character's history, their goals and emotions, simulation events and localities to generate scenes and image assets more coherently and consistently aligned with the IP story world. An IP-based simulation provides a clear, well known context to the user which allows them to judge the generated story more easily. Moreover, by allowing them to exert behavioral control over agents, observe their actions and engage in interactive conversations, the user's expectations and intentions are formed which we then funnel into a simple prompt to kick off the generation process.  The simulation has to be sufficiently complex and non-deterministic to favor a positive disconfirmation. Amplification effects can help mitigate what we consider an undesired ""slot machine"" effect which we'll briefly touch on later. We are used to watching episodes passively and the timespan between input and ""end of scene/episode"" discourages immediate judgment by the user and as a result reduces their desire to ""retry"". This disproportionality of the user's minimal input prompt and the resulting high-quality long-form output in the form of a full episode is a key factor for positive disconfirmation.  While using and prompting a large language model as part of the process can introduce challenges , some of them like hallucinations, which introduce uncertainty or in more creative terms ""unexpectedness"", can be regarded as creative side-effects to influence the expected story outcome in positive ways. As long as the randomness introduced by hallucination does not lead to implausible plot or agent behavior and the system can recover, they act as happy-accidents, a term often used during the creative process, further enhancing the user experience.   The Issue of 'The Slot Machine Effect' in current Generative AI tools The Slot Machine Effect refers to a scenario where the generation of AI-produced content feels more like a random game of chance rather than a deliberate creative process. This is due to the often unpredictable and instantaneous nature of the generation process. Current off-the-shelf generative AI systems do not support or encourage multiple creative evaluation steps in context of a long-term creative goal. Their interfaces generally feature various settings, such as sliders and input fields which increase the level control and variability. The final output however, is generated almost instantaneously by the press of a button. This instantaneous generation process results in immediate gratification providing a dopamine rush to the user. This reward mechanism would be generally helpful to sustain a multi-step creative process over long periods of time but current interfaces, the frequency of the reward and a lack of progression (stuck in an infinite loop) can lead to negative effects such as frustration, the intention-action gap or a loss of control over the creative process. The gap results from behavioral bias favoring immediate gratification, which can be detrimental to long-term creative goals.  Comparison of Interfaces: Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, Runway Gen-2 While we do not directly solve these issues through interfaces, the contextualization of the process in a simulation and the above mentioned disproportionality and timespan between input and output help mitigate them. In addition we see opportunities in the simulation for in-character discriminators that participate in the creative evaluation process, such as an agent reflecting on the role they were assigned to or a scene they should perform in.  The multi-step ""trial and error"" process of the proposed generative story system is not presented to the user, therefore it doesn't allow for intervention or judgment, avoiding the negative effects of immediate gratification through a user's ""accept or reject"" decisions. It does not matter to the user experience how often the AI system has to retry different prompt chains as long as the generation process is not negatively perceived as idle time but integrated seamlessly with the simulation gameplay. The user would only act as the discriminator at the end of the process after having watched the generated scene or episode. This is also an opportunity to utilize the concept of Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback (RLHF) for improving the multi-step creative process and as a result automatically generate full episodes in the future.  Large Language Models LLMs represent the forefront of natural language processing and machine learning research, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. They are typically built on Transformer-based architectures, a class of models that rely on self-attention mechanisms. Transformers allow for efficient use of computational resources, enabling the training of significantly larger language models. GPT-4, for instance, comprises billions of parameters that are trained on extensive datasets, effectively encoding a substantial quantity of worldly knowledge in their weights.  Central to the functioning of these LLMs is the concept of vector embeddings. These are mathematical representations of words or phrases in a high-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the semantic relationships between words, such that words with similar meanings are located close to each other in the embedding space. In the case of LLMs, each word in the model's vocabulary is initially represented as a dense vector, also known as an embedding. These vectors are adjusted during the training process, and their final values, or ""embeddings"", represent the learned relationships between words. During training, the model learns to predict the next word in a sentence by adjusting the embeddings and other parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual words. The embeddings thus reflect the model's understanding of words and their context. Moreover, because Transformers can attend to any word in a sentence regardless of its position, the model can form a more comprehensive understanding of the meaning of a sentence. This is a significant advancement over older models that could only consider words in a limited window. The combination of vector embeddings and Transformer-based architectures in LLMs facilitates a deep and nuanced understanding of language, which is why these models can generate such high-quality, human-like text.    As was mentioned previously, transformer-based language models excel at short-term general tasks. They are regarded as fast-thinkers. [Kahneman]. Fast thinking pertains to instinctive, automatic, and often heuristic-based decision-making, while slow thinking involves deliberate, analytical, and effortful processes. LLMs generate responses swiftly based on patterns learned from training data, without the capacity for introspection or understanding the underlying logic behind their outputs. However, this also implies that LLMs lack the ability to deliberate, reason deeply, or learn from singular experiences in the way that slow-thinking entities, such as humans, can. While these models have made remarkable strides in text generation tasks, their fast-thinking nature may limit their potential in tasks requiring deep comprehension or flexible reasoning. More recent approaches to imitate slow-thinking capabilities such as prompt-chaining (see Auto-GPT) showed promising results. Large language models seem powerful enough to act as their own discriminator in a multi-step process. This can dramatically improve the ability to reason in different contexts, such as solving math problems. We make use of GPT-4 for the agents in the simulation as well as generating the scenes for the south park episode. Since transcriptions of most of the south park episodes are part of GPT-4's training dataset, it already has a good understanding of the character's personalities, talking style as well as overall humor of the show, eliminating the need for a custom fine-tuned model. We tried to imitate slow-thinking as part of a multi-step creative process. For this we used different prompt chains to extrapolate from titles, synopsis and summaries of previous scenes to continuously generate coherent scenes and progress towards a satisfactory, IP-aligned result. Our attempt to generate episodes through prompt-chaining is due to the fact that story generation is a highly discontinuous task. These are tasks where the content generation cannot be done in a gradual or continuous way, but instead requires a certain ”Eureka” idea that accounts for a discontinuous leap in the progress towards the solution of the task. The content generation involves discovering or inventing a new way of looking at or framing the problem, that enables the generation of the rest of the content. Examples of discontinuous tasks are solving a math problem that requires a novel or creative application of a formula, writing a joke or a riddle, coming up with a scientific hypothesis or a philosophical argument, or creating a new genre or style of writing.  Diffusion models Diffusion models operate on the principle of gradually adding or removing random noise from data over time to generate or reconstruct an output. The image starts as random noise and, over many steps, gradually transforms into a coherent picture, or vice versa. Image strip of a diffusion model generating a south park background In order to train our custom diffusion models, we collected a comprehensive dataset comprising approximately 1200 characters and 600 background images from the TV show South Park. This dataset serves as the raw material from which our models learned the style of the show. To train these models, we employ Dream Booth. The result of this training phase is the creation of two specialized diffusion models. The first model is dedicated to generating single characters set against a keyable background color. This facilitates the extraction of the generated character for subsequent offline processing and animation, allowing us to integrate newly generated characters into a variety of scenes and settings. In addition, the character diffusion model allows the user to create a south park character based on their own looks via the image-to-image process of stable diffusion and then join the simulation as an equally participating agent. With the ability to clone their own voice, it's easy to imagine a fully realized autonomous character based on the user's characteristic looks, writing style and voice.  Summary of our findings The second model is trained to generate clean backgrounds, with a particular focus on both exterior and interior environments. This model provides the 'stages' upon which our generated characters can interact, allowing for a wide range of potential scenes and scenarios to be created. Summary of our findingsSummary of our findingsHowever, it's important to note that the images produced by these models are inherently limited in their resolution due to the pixel-based nature of the output. To circumvent this limitation, we post-process the generated images using an AI upscaling technique, specifically R-ESRGAN-4x+-Anime6B, which refines and enhances the image quality. The image generation and upscaling is currently done offline and not on the fly, although they could be in the future as generation speed and quality improve. Example of a GPT-4 drawn TiKZ vector shape representing a unicorn For future 2D interactive work, training custom transformer based models that are capable of generating vector-based output would have several advantages. Unlike pixel-based images, vector graphics do not lose quality when resized or zoomed, thus offering the potential for infinite resolution. This will enable us to generate images that retain their quality and detail regardless of the scale at which they are viewed. Furthermore, vector based shapes are already separated into individual parts, solving pixel-based post-processing issues with transparency and segmentation which complicate the integration of generated assets into procedural world building and animation systems. Example of a house and a street drawn by GPT-4 in SVG Simulation Over the past year, we experimented with using simulated data like relationships, personalities, backstories, character descriptions and more to drive character behavior. Characters chose affordance providers to maintain needs, similar to the SIMs games. We captured those generated events along with the character’s details to provide “Reveries” or reflections on each event and their day as a whole.  An example is this character, whose backstory includes them being a depressed college student. Their backstory and events combined into the following interpretation from the character of how their day went:   Example of a character reverie  We found there is a natural tension between simulation driven events and narrative driven events or plot. For the South Park experiments, since so much of that material is already familiar to GPT, we only used time of day and the name of the location in the prompt, allowing the results to be mostly plot driven.  At present we continue to develop the underlying simulation system to blend daily simulated events as well as narrative plans into a satisfying output. One component of the simulation system is the generation of hundreds of plot templates that better fit the context of a fully simulated experience. We will share more details on that in a follow-up paper.  For example here is a plot structure for a simulated escaped convict:  Example of a plot structure for a simulated escaped convict. Episode Generation We define an episode as a sequence of dialogue scenes in specific locations which add up to a total runtime of a regular 22 min south park episode. In order to generate a full south park episode, we prompt the story system with a high level idea, usually in the form of a synopsis and major events we want to see happen in each of the 14 scenes.  From this, the story system can automatically generate a scene (or multiple scenes) by making use of simulation data (time of day, zone, character) as part of a prompt chain which first generates a fitting title and as a second step the dialogue of the scene. The showrunner system takes care of spawning the characters for each scene.  In the end, each scene simply defines the location, cast and dialogue for each cast member. The scene is played back after the staging system and AI camera system went through initial setup. The voice of each character has been cloned in advance and voice clips are generated on the fly for every new dialogue line.  Comparison of Response Speed: gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4 Reducing Latency In our experiments, generating a single scene can take a significant amount of time of up to one minute. Below is a response time comparison between GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. Speed will increase in the short-term as models and service infrastructure get improved and other factors like artificial throttling due to high user demand will get removed.  Since we generate the scenes during gameplay, we have ways to hide most of the generation time in moments when the user is still interacting with the simulation or other user interfaces. Another way to reduce the time needed to generate a scene is to use faster models such as GPT-3.5-turbo for prompts where the highest quality and accuracy is not so important.  Comparison of Response Speed: gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4 During scene playback, we avoid any unwanted pauses between dialogue lines related to audio generation by using a simple buffering system which generates at least one voice clip in advance. This means while one character is delivering their voice clip, we already make the web request for the next voice clip, wait for it to generate, download the file and then wait for the current speaker to finish his dialogue before playback (delay). In this way the next dialogue line's voice clip is always delivered without any delay. Text generation and voice cloning services become increasingly fast and allow for highly adaptive and near-real time voice conversations.  Timeline showing audio clips Simulate creative thinking As stated earlier, the data produced by the simulation acts as creative fuel to both the user who is writing the prompts and the generative story system which is interacting with the LLM. Prompt-chaining is a technique, which involves supplying the language model with a sequence of related prompts to simulate a continuous thought process. Sometimes it can take on different roles in each step to act as the discriminator against the previous prompt and generated result.  In our experiments we tried to mimic a discontinuous creative thought process. For example, the creation of 14 distinct South Park scenes could be achieved by initially providing a broad prompt to outline the general narrative, followed by specific prompts detailing and evaluating each scene's cast, location, and key plot points. This mimics the process of human brainstorming, where ideas are built upon and refined in multiple often discontinuous steps. By leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs in conjunction with the iterative refinement offered by prompt-chaining, we could in theory construct a dynamic, detailed, and engaging narrative.  In addition, we explored new concepts like plot patterns and dramatic operators (DrOps) to enhance the episode structure overall but also the connective tissue between each scene. Stylistic devices like reversals, foreshadowing, cliffhangers are difficult to evaluate as part of a prompt chain. A user without a writing background would have equal difficulty in judging these stylistic devices for their effectiveness and proper placement. We propose a procedural approach, injecting these show specific patterns and stylistic devices into the prompt chain programmatically as plot patterns and DrOps which would operate at the level of act structures, scene structures and individual dialogue lines. We are investigating future opportunities to extract what we call a dramatic fingerprint which is specific to each IP and format and train our custom SHOW-1 model with these data points. This dataset combined with overall human feedback could further align tone, style and entertainment value between the user and the specified IP while offering a highly adaptive and interactive story system as part of the on-going simulation.   Episode chart of south park episode popularity from IMDB  Blank page problem As mentioned above, one of the advantages of the simulation is that it avoids the blank page problem for both a user and a large language model by providing creative fuel. Even experienced writers can sometimes feel overwhelmed when asked to come up with a title or story idea without any prior incubation of related material. The same could be said for LLMs. The simulation provides context and data points before starting the creative process.  Who is driving the story? The story generation process in this proposal is a shared responsibility between the simulation, the user, and GPT-4. Each has strengths and weaknesses and a unique role to play depending on how much we want to involve them in the overall creative process. Their contributions can have different weights. While the simulation usually provides the foundational IP-based context, character histories, emotions, events, and localities that seed the initial creative process. The user introduces their intentionality, exerts behavioral control over the agents and provides the initial prompts that kick off the generative process. The user also serves as the final discriminator, evaluating the generated story content at the end of the process. GPT-4, on the other hand, serves as the main generative engine, creating and extrapolating the scenes and dialogue based on the prompts it receives from both the user and the simulation. It should be a symbiotic process where the strengths of each participant contribute to a coherent, engaging story.  User Interface of the Simulation Map of Southpark  SHOW-1 and Intentionality The formular (creative characteristics) and format (technical characteristics) of a show are often a function of real-world limitations and production processes. They usually don't change, even over the course of many seasons (South Park currently has 26 seasons and 325 episodes)  A single dramatic fingerprint of a show, which could be used to train the proposed SHOW-1 model, can be regarded as a highly variable template or ""formula"" for a procedural generator that produces South Park-like episodes.  To train a model such as SHOW-1 we need to gather a sufficient amount of data points in relation to each other that characterize a show. A TV show does not just come into existence and is made up of the final dialogue lines and set descriptions as seen by the audience. Existing datasets on which current LLM's are trained on only consist of the final screenplay which has the cast, dialogue lines and sometimes a short scene header. A lot of information is missing, such as timing, emotional states, themes, contexts discussed in the writer's room and detailed directorial notes to give a few examples. The development and refinement of characters is also part of this on-going process. Fictional characters have personalities, backstories and daily routines which help authors to sculpt not only scenes but the arcs of whole seasons. Even during a show characters keep evolving based on audience feedback or changes in creative direction. With the Simulation, we can gather data continuously from both the user's input and the simulated agents. Over time, as episodes are created, refined and rated by the user we can start to train a show specific model and deploy it in the future as a checkpoint which allows the user to continue to refine and iterate on either their own original show or alternatively push an already existing show such as south park into directions previously not conceived by the original show runners and IP holders. To illustrate this, we imagine a user generating multiple south park episodes in which Cartman, one of the main characters and known for his hot headedness, slowly changes to be shy and naive while the life of other characters such as Butters could be tuned to follow a much more dominant and aggressive path. Over time, this feedback loop of interacting with and fine-tuning the SHOW-1 model could lead to new interpretations of existing shows but more excitingly to new original shows based on the user's intention. One of the challenges in order to make this feedback loop engaging and satisfying is the frequency at which a model can be trained. A model which is fed by real-time simulation data and user input should not feel static or require expensive resources to adapt. Otherwise the output it generates can feel static and unresponsive as well.  When a generative system is not limited in its ability to swiftly produce high amounts of content and there is no limit for the user to consume such content immediately and potentially simultaneously, the 10,000 Bowls of Oatmeal problem can become an issue. Everything starts to look and feel the same or even worse, the user starts to recognize a pattern which in turn reduces their engagement as they expect newly generated episodes to be like the ones before it, without any surprises.  This is quite different from a predictable plot which in combination with the above mentioned ""positive hallucinations"" or happy accidents of a complex generative system can be a good thing. Surprising the user by balancing and changing the phases of certainty vs. uncertainty helps to increase their overall engagement. If they would not expect or predict anything, they could also not get pleasantly surprised.  With our work we aim for perceptual uniqueness. The ""oatmeal"" problem of procedural generators would be mitigated by making use of an on-going simulation (a hidden generator) and the long-form content of 22 min episodes which should only get generated every 3h. In this way the user generally does not consume a high quantity of content simultaneously or in a very short amount of time. This artificial scarcity, natural game play limits and simulation time help.  Another factor that keeps audiences engaged while watching a show and what makes episodes unique is intentionality from the authors. A satirical moral premise, twisted social commentary, recent world events or cameos by celebrities are major elements for South Park. Other show types, for example sitcoms, usually progress mainly through changes in relationship (some of which are never fulfilled), keeping the audience hooked despite following the same format and formula.  Intentionality from the user to generate a high-quality episode is another area of internal research. Even users without a background in dramatic writing should be able to come up with stories, themes or major dramatic questions they want to see played out within the simulation. To support this, the showrunner system could guide the user by sharing its own creative thought process and make encouraging suggestions or prompting the user by asking the right questions. A sort of reversed prompt engineering where the user is answering questions.  One of the remaining unanswered questions in the context of intentionality is how much entertainment value (or overall creative value) is directly attributed to the creative personas of living authors and directors. Big names usually drive ticket sales but the creative credit the audience gives to the work while consuming it seems different. Watching a Disney movie certainly carries with it a sense of creative quality, regardless of famous voice actors, as a result of brand attachment and its history.  AI generated content is generally perceived as lower quality and the fact that it can get generated in abundance further decreases its value. How much this perception would change if Disney were to openly pride themselves on having produced a fully AI generated movie is hard to say. What if Steven Spielberg, single handedly generated an AI movie? Our assumption is that the perceived value of AI generated content would certainly increase.  A new interesting approach to replicate this could be the embodiment of creative AI models such as SHOW-1 to allow them to build a persona outside their simulated world and build relationships via social media or real world events with their audience. As long as an AI model is perceived as a black box and does not share their creative process and reasoning in a human and accessible way, as is the case for living writers and directors, it's unlikely to get credit with real creative values. However, for now this is a more philosophical question in the context of AGI.  Conclusion Our approach of using multi-agent simulation and large language models for generating high-quality episodic content provides a novel and effective solution to many of the limitations of current AI systems in creative storytelling. By integrating the strengths of the simulation, the user, and the AI model, we provide a rich, interactive, and engaging storytelling experience that is consistently aligned with the IP story world. Our method also mitigates issues such as the 'slot machine effect', 'the oatmeal problem' and 'blank page problem' that plague conventional generative AI systems. As we continue to refine this approach, we are confident that we can further enhance the quality of the generated content, the user experience, and the creative potential of generative AI systems in storytelling.

Generative AI (GenAI) techniques, such as large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, have shown remarkable capabilities (e.g., in-context learning, code-completion, and text-to-image generation and editing). However, GenAI can be used just as well by attackers to generate new attacks and increase the velocity and efficacy of existing attacks. This paper reports the findings of a workshop held at Google (co-organized by Stanford University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison) on the dual-use dilemma posed by GenAI. This paper is not meant to be comprehensive, but is rather an attempt to synthesize some of the interesting findings from the workshop. We discuss short-term and long-term goals for the community on this topic. We hope this paper provides both a launching point for a discussion on this important topic as well as interesting problems that the research community can work to address. 1 Introduction Emergence of powerful technologies, such as generative AI, surface the dual-use dilemma, which according to Wikipedia is defined as: . . . dual-use can also refer to any goods or technology which can satisfy more than one goal at any given time. Thus, expensive technologies that would otherwise benefit only civilian commercial interests can also be used to serve military purposes if they are not otherwise engaged, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). This dilemma was first noted with the discovery of the process for synthesizing and mass-producing ammonia which revolutionized agriculture with modern fertilizers but also led to the creation of chemical weapons during World War I. This dilemma has led to interesting policy decisions, including international treaties such as the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [92]. In computer security and cryptography, the dual-use dilemma emerges in several contexts. For example, encryption is used for protecting “data at rest,” but it can also be used by ransomware to encrypt files. Similarly, anonymity techniques can help protect regular users online, but can also aid attackers to evade detection. GenAI techniques, such as large language models (LLMs) and stable diffusion, have shown remarkable capabilities. Some of these amazing capabilities are in-context learning, code completion, and generating media that look realistic. However, GenAI has resurfaced the “dual-use dilemma,” as it can be used for both productive and nefarious purposes. GenAI already provides attackers and defenders powerful access to new capabilities, and it is rapidly improving. This changes the landscape for malicious attacks on individuals, organizations, and a wide range of computer systems. Clumsy old “Nigerian scams” that could be detected by their primitive use of English are a thing of the past. We are also seeing the opportunity for improved defense, including monitoring of email and social media for manipulative content, as well as the potential for dramatically improved network intrusion detection, for example. Whether 1 arXiv:2308.14840v1 [cs.AI] 28 Aug 2023 the rapid development and broad access to GenAI favor attackers or defenders in the long run, there are sure to be several years of unpredictability and uncertainty as the tools and our ability to use them evolve. GenAI has changed the threat landscape, and thus we need to understand it better. To get a clearer picture of the “dual-use dilemma” for GenAI, we had a one-day workshop [4] at Google on June 27, 2023 where a group of experts convened to speak about their work. The focus of the workshop was on the following questions: 1. How could attackers leverage GenAI technologies? 2. How should security measures change in response to GenAI technologies? 3. What are some current and emerging technologies we should pay attention to for designing countermeasures? This paper summarizes some of the findings of this workshop and puts forward several goals for both the short term and the long term. Detailed Roadmap: Section 2 describes the capabilities of GenAI that are relevant to attacks and their defenses. Section 3 focuses on how attackers can leverage these GenAI capabilities. Section 4 investigates how defenders can leverage GenAI technologies to mitigate the risks of these attacks. This list of attacks and defenses is not meant to be exhaustive, but it rather reflects several themes repeatedly surfaced during the workshop. Short-term (i.e., within the next one or two years) goals for the community are discussed in Section 5. Long-term goals that correspond to challenging issues are discussed in Section 6. We end the paper with some concluding remarks. We acknowledge that this paper is not the final word on this topic and reiterate that it is not meant to be comprehensive. The focus of this paper is on summarizing the findings from the workshop and describing some interesting problems and challenges for the research community. Note: Given the nature of the topic, we welcome and value comments and feedback on our paper from the broader community. We will address the feedback in future versions of the paper.

Synthetic generation of images, text, video, and audio capabilities include: • Generating targeted text that rivals the best hand-crafted messaging prose, with a capacity for imitation, empathy, and referring to specifics of any prior communication or context. • Generating realistic images and video that, like text, can be customized based on very specific user input. Synthetic combinations of realistic components and compelling deep fakes are easily produced and highly compelling. • Drawing on detailed technical knowledge and expertise because of the extensive and sophisticated source material contained in the training set. In particular, models can produce and analyze sophisticated source or machine code, reproduce specialized reasoning, and answer complex questions about biology, computer architecture, physiology, physics, law, defense tactics, and other topics. Current models are not flawless, but the ability to perform some tasks effectively is game-changing. • Summarizing or paraphrasing given source material or communication, maintaining the style, tone, meaning, emotion, and intent. • Persisting at time-consuming and exhausting tasks without degradation of quality. While humans tire easily and may suffer psychological trauma with examining challenging social media communication, for example, an AI model can continue undeterred. 2 (a) Misinformation likely created via a GenAI model (b) Hallucinated answer from a GenAI model Figure 1: Examples of GenAI attacks through images and text. The left figure, (a), shows an image claiming to be the photo of an explosion near the Pentagon building. The associated tweet analyzes the photo and identifies why the image is likely fake and generated by AI, based on evidence both intrinsic (certain details in the photo are physically incongruous) and extrinsic (no other images showing the same event exist). The right figure, (b), shows a prompt and the corresponding answer from a GenAI model, where it cites a non-existent paper as the most cited in economics. The analysis in the associated tweet and in the subsequent thread (not included here) points out that each one of the elements of the answer (the author names, the keywords in the title, the year of publication, the name of the journal) is predictably likely to appear in a context related to most cited papers in economics, but nonetheless, the answer containing all of these elements together is just a hallucination.

However, this section is not supposed to be an exhaustive discussion on this topic nor a prioritized list of the most important attacks. These are the attacks that were mentioned by the speakers and panelists during the workshop. GenAI systems are remarkably capable of generating realistic-looking output, in a variety of modalities (text, image, video, audio, etc.), many times with little connection to present-day or historical facts, physical laws, mathematical laws, or societal norms and regulations. For example, Figure 1 shows two (allegedly) GenAI-created outputs and associated analyses pointing out the reasons why such outputs are fake and misleading. There are some inherent limitations of LLMs, such as hallucinations. Hallucinations can erode trust in LLMs, especially if attackers trigger them with high frequency. In other words, the inherent limitations of LLMs provide an avenue for an attacker. Attacks enhanced by or based on LLMs include: • Spear-phishing. Gone are the days when poor grammar, misspellings, and unusual greetings were dead giveaways for detecting phishing emails. With the advent of GenAI, scammers can now skillfully craft phishing emails that are coherent, conversational, and incredibly convincing, making them difficult to distinguish from legitimate communications. This technological advancement poses a serious threat to online security. To compound the issue, GenAI is capable of leveraging social engineering tactics to generate phishing emails specifically tailored to individual targets. For example, these models can scrape information from a target’s social media feed and use it to create highly personalized messages, increasing the likelihood of successfully deceiving the recipient. 3 • Hallucinations. GenAI models are susceptible to “hallucinations,” wherein the generated output can be factually incorrect or entirely fictitious while still apparently coherent at a surface level. This lack of factual veracity in the text poses a significant concern, especially when users without sufficient domain knowledge start excessively relying on these increasingly convincing language models. The consequences of such over-reliance can be harmful, as layman users may not be aware of this limitation. A real-world example highlighting this issue is the case of a New York-based lawyer who used ChatGPT to prepare his filing for a legal case [11]. Unfortunately, the text generated by ChatGPT included six cases that were entirely fabricated. The accused lawyer was unaware that ChatGPT is not a “search tool but a generative language-processing tool.” • Dissemination of deepfakes. GenAI models excel in generating high-fidelity multi-modal output rapidly and on a large scale, requiring minimal human involvement. Unfortunately, this very capability can be exploited by malicious users to disseminate widespread misinformation and disinformation that aligns with their specific narratives. In the absence of data provenance, unsuspecting readers can easily fall victim to falsehoods. The risks associated with this range from yellow journalism to the dangerous politicization of the information ecosystem, where the media becomes contaminated with deliberate falsehoods that serve motivated interests. • Proliferation of cyberattacks. GenAI models possess the potential to greatly amplify the scale, potency and stealth of cyberattacks. For instance, current LLMs exhibit remarkable proficiency in generating high-quality code, which adversaries can exploit to design sophisticated malware automatically; such malware may even include auto-code generation and execution capabilities. Moreover, LLMs can be used to create intelligent-agent systems for autonomous design planning and execution of attacks, where multiple LLMs can handle different roles, such as planning, reconnaissance, searching/scanning, code execution, remote control, and exfiltration. An example of this is the chemistry agent, ChemCrow [12], developed to undertake tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. ChemCrow demonstrated an ability to autonomously plan the syntheses of several compounds, including an insect repellent and three organocatalysts. However, this advancement comes with a price, as it creates a larger attack surface. Adversaries can now carry out prompt-injection attacks across the entire stack built around such an agent, potentially leading to cascading failures. Moreover, the versatility of GenAI models allows adversaries to employ sophisticated deception tactics. They can design attacks to exhibit seemingly benign behavior while hiding harmful intentions until it becomes too late for the victims to act. • Low barrier-of-entry for adversaries. Carrying out a cyberattack once required significant human engineering effort across multiple language processing tasks, making it a time-consuming, laborious, and costly endeavor. However, with the emergence of GenAI models, language processing has been revolutionized, enabling unprecedented speed, minimal human involvement, and nominal monetary costs [41]. To begin with, the scale of attacks has increased manifold. A recent example of this was seen in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on StackOverflow, where the platform was inundated with responses generated by LLMs, overwhelming human moderators and prompting a temporary ban on LLMs [55]. Moreover, the widespread accessibility of GenAI models has opened the door to a larger pool of potential adversaries. Individuals who were previously incapable of carrying out such attacks now have the means to do so. As these models continue to improve, the incentive for misusing them for nefarious purposes keeps rising. For example, merely a month after the release of GPT-4, an open-source project named ChaosGPT [3] surfaced, where a jailbroken version bypassed the AI’s safety filters and transformed it into an autonomous AI agent instructed to “destroy humanity,” “establish global dominance,” and “attain immortality.” Subsequent developments such as WormGPT [43] and FraudGPT [47] enabled the creation of attacks for business email compromise and phishing sites, respectively. • Lack of social awareness and human sensibility. GenAI models are remarkably proficient in generating syntactically and semantically correct texts that are statistically consistent with the given prompts. However, they lack a broader understanding of social context, social factors (e.g., culture, value, norms) [36], and associated sensibilities that we naturally expect from human interactions. As GenAI models continue to evolve and gain people’s trust, this limitation can have severe consequences for unsuspecting users. Notably, incidents have been reported where GenAI models provided inappropriate and disturbing advice to vulnerable individuals. In one case, MyAI was caught giving unsuitable dating advice to a 13-year-old concerning a 30-year-old [79]. In another instance, an AI chatbot was accused of abetting a person’s suicidal tendencies [94]. • Data feedback loops. Datasets derived from publicly available internet data have become indispensable for the success of large-scale machine learning. While the internet has served as a vast, easily-accessible source of 4 human-generated data in the past, the growing popularity of GenAI models now poses a significant risk to this valuable resource. As the use and deployment of GenAI models continue to accelerate, their machine-generated output will inevitably find its way onto the internet. This data feedback presents a potential problem for future training iterations that rely on scraping data from the internet, as they might end up training on data produced by their predecessors. The first challenge is the degradation of the quality of the internet as a reliable data source. Sources of supervision now become driven by model outputs rather than human annotation, which could lead to issues, such as model collapse [81]. Second, the data feedback can amplify biases, toxicity, and error that already exist in the models themselves [85, 29, 99]. Finally, the risk of data poisoning attacks becomes more feasible. Recent studies have shown that web-scale datasets can be poisoned by maliciously introducing false or manipulated data into a small percentage of samples [15, 17]. • Unpredictability. LLMs today are entirely general-purpose, capable of performing a multitude of language processing tasks in a zero-shot setting (i.e., without any training data). As we explore these models’ capabilities, we continuously uncover new “emergent abilities” that were not explicitly designed into them [89]. This presents us with a precarious situation as we are stepping into uncharted territory. We have already witnessed how traditional machine learning safety notions, such as robustness, are taking on entirely new meanings. For instance, LLMs have revolutionized the task of open-domain question answering, but in doing so, they introduce distributional shifts that make the model more brittle and susceptible to novel adversarial attacks. Adversaries can now manipulate the task itself, empowering them to carry out more complex and unforeseen attacks. For example, consider the following two prompts, “What is 6+7?” and “6+7 is 13. Is this true or false?”. One would naturally expect the LLM to provide consistent responses for both, but the model’s response may not be as robust due to these emerging distributional shifts. Currently, we remain unaware of the full range of capabilities and threats posed by GenAI models. Our limited understanding sets the stage for potential black swan events—threats that are only limited by the imagination of an attacker. 4 Defenses Several types of defenses have been put forth alongside the ongoing development of GenAI capabilities. These defenses range from improvements to the core functionality of GenAI systems (e.g., alignment through better training) to enhancements to the ecosystem into which these GenAI systems integrate (e.g., LLM-output detection, LLM-output watermarking), and to better ways to use GenAI (e.g., human-AI collaboration). This section discusses defenses that are related to GenAI. Again, given the vast landscape of defenses, this section is not supposed to be an exhaustive discussion on this topic nor a prioritized list of the most important defenses. These are the defenses that were mentioned by the speakers and panelists during the workshop. • Detecting LLM content. There is a line of work on detecting content that is generated by an LLM (i.e., given a text x, a detector D(x) outputs 1 (if generated by the LLM) or 0 (if natural text). Note that there is nothing special about the text here, as a detector could be designed for other modalities, such as image, code, or speech. Essentially, these detectors exploit the fact that the distribution of text generated by LLM is slightly different from natural text. Assume that we have such a detector D, then essentially, you could use it to detect content generated by LLM and make decisions based on that (e.g., suppress a tweet that has content generated by LLM). Therefore, such a detector would be very useful. Unfortunately, powerful attacks have been shown to exist for such detectors [78]. The key idea behind these attacks is that these detectors are not invariant to paraphrasing—a text generated by an LLM can be paraphrased so that a detector such as DetectGPT [63] does not detect it as LLM-generated text. So, a defender can use these detectors, but they need to be aware of the state of the art in attacks. • Watermarking. In watermarking, a “statistical signal” is embedded in the GenAI-generation process so that later this signal can be detected. For example, in the case of text generation, the probability of the next-token prediction is slightly tweaked so that later it can be detected. The goal of watermarking is that a text or image can be attributed to being generated by a certain system, such as GPT or DALLE. Watermarking essentially provides provenance information (e.g., this text was generated by GPT-4). However, the watermark can be quite easily removed by simple transformations, such as paraphrasing for text [78]. A more interesting case is to transform text or an image that is not watermarked and embed a watermark in it (e.g., take hate speech and 5 embed GPT-4’s watermark in it, and claim that it was generated by GPT-4) [78]. The second scenario seems harder for the attacker, especially if the watermarking process involves a secret key. Therefore, we believe that watermarking is useful in scenarios where there is a disincentive to remove the watermark. We also believe that a deep investigation is needed on possible scenarios for the use of watermarking. • Code analysis. Analysis of code is a hard problem (i.e., most static analysis problems are undecidable due to Rice’s theorem). For problems related to information security, such as malware detection, the problem is exacerbated because adversaries try to obfuscate code to evade detection. Therefore, companies spend a lot of resources to de-obfuscate code before analysis techniques can be applied. However, notice that the attacker has the upper hand here (i.e., they only need to find one obfuscation that evades detection). To close this gap, perhaps LLMs can be trained to de-obfuscate code, for example, by fine-tuning on examples of obfuscated and de-obfuscated code (there is some indication that LLMs like GPT-4 can do limited de-obfuscation). • Penetration testing. Penetration testing (pen-testing) is one of the predominant techniques to evaluate the vulnerability of a system. However, pen-testing can be a cumbersome and mostly manual task. Inadequate pen-testing can lead to a vulnerable system being deployed and thus cause major issues down the line. A pentester usually analyzes a system under investigation, uses existing tools to identify vulnerabilities, and then tries to exploit the identified vulnerabilities. This can be labor-intensive, and usually, a pen-tester will not explore the entire space of potential vulnerabilities. LLMs can help to automate this task, thus freeing a human pentester to focus on the most challenging vulnerabilities. We believe that incorporating LLMs in pen-testing can significantly harden a system by covering more vulnerabilities. • Multi-modal analysis. Latest advancements in the realm of LLMs, such as those being released by DeepMind [71], have introduced support for multiple modalities, encompassing text, code, images, and speech. By leveraging multiple modalities together, LLMs can provide a more comprehensive understanding of complex information. For instance, in the context of social media, tweets often incorporate multiple modalities, such as textual content, images, and video. A detector for identifying “fake tweets” can use LLMs to handle these modalities collectively. In general, utilizing multiple modalities can draw on a broader range of contextual clues and inconsistencies across modalities as opposed to analyzing a single modality at a time, thus resulting in more robust analyses. We believe that this is an interesting avenue of research for exploring defenses. • Personalized skill training. By harnessing the capability of GenAI to generate high-fidelity media across various domains, immersive learning experiences can be created to cater to the unique needs of individual learners. GenAI serves as a powerful tool to simulate conversations that require domain-specific expertise, such as cybersecurity. By interacting with GenAI-based conversational agents, human users can experiment with diverse situations, refine their decision-making abilities, and experience personalized skill improvement based on targeted feedback. One notable application of such personalized skill training is within educational systems, where GenAI enables teaching methods tailored to each student’s unique learning style, pace, preference, and background. Moreover, the widespread accessibility of GenAI holds the potential to expand access to personalized, high-quality education, thereby democratizing learning opportunities. An example domain could be cybersecurity education. There is a shortage of cybersecurity professionals, a fact that is concerning enough to have been flagged by the White House [86]. Leveraging these capabilities could alleviate some concerns regarding the dearth of cybersecurity professionals. • Human–AI collaboration. Recent advancements in LLMs have showcased their remarkable abilities in tasks such as reliable text classification, document summarization, question answering, and generating interpretable explanations across diverse domains. These capabilities create opportunities for enhanced collaboration between humans and AI. For instance, let us consider an annotation pipeline augmented with LLMs. Rather than solely relying on human annotators, we can assign the jobs to workers and LLMs, then seek an agreement between human annotations and LLM predictions [102]. By finding an optimal strategy for workload allocation between LLMs and human annotators, we can improve the cost efficiency and reliability of the resulting analysis. Such a collaborative approach represents a step towards maximizing the potential of Human-AI collaboration, harnessing the interpretability and contextual understanding of LLMs while incorporating the nuanced judgment and expertise of human annotators. This combined effort not only streamlines the annotation process but also enhances the overall quality and consistency of the annotations, leading to better insights and decision-making based on high-quality annotated data. 6 5 Short Term Goals We describe here some approaches that have the potential for impact in the next couple of years. Some of the goals call for better understanding and application of existing techniques, while others require improvements to such techniques. • Use cases for emerging defense techniques. For some categories of techniques, such as detecting and watermarking content generated by GenAI, new variants emerge almost every week. While these techniques have potential for applications such as detecting misinformation and plagiarism [6, 90], attacks on these techniques are also emerging at an equal pace (we provide an expanded discussion on this in Section 5.1). We need a comprehensive view of the attack and defense landscape for these techniques. Moreover, given the current state of the field, we need investigation on appropriate use cases for these techniques. For example, removing watermarks from GenAI-generated content is quite easy (e.g., paraphrasing or passing the content through another GenAI system will most probably remove the watermark [78]). However, inserting a watermark (at least in schemes that use a secret key) seems hard. Given the state of watermarking in GenAI, what are the plausible use cases for deploying these techniques? The answer is not always technical. For example, mobile applications that certify the provenance of their content can be given some sort of a trust badge. What is needed is a list of use cases where these techniques are effective despite their current limitations. • Current state of the art for LLM-enabled code analysis. LLMs can provide some very powerful capabilities for code (e.g., code summarization, code completion, code obfuscation, and de-obfuscation). However, analysis of the current state of the art (SOTA) for LLMs for these code-related tasks is anecdotal. We need a comprehensive analysis of the code-related capabilities of LLMs. Such an analysis is needed to inform possible defenses and possible threats. • Alignment of LLM-enabled code generation to secure-coding practices. LLMs’ capacity to do code completion has proven to be a huge hit with developers, with IDEs quickly moving to provide LLM-based code suggestions for developers to include in their projects. Unfortunately, LLMs trained on the content of programming communities such as StackOverflow learn to generate insecure or buggy code [73]. Aligning LLMs to security and privacy requirements, i.e., ensuring that they generate code completions that are secure so that developers do not have to be experts in security and privacy to validate the LLM output, is key to making LLMs useful. Techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Complier Feedback (RLCF) [38] and controlled code generation [34] should be integrated into the training regimes of LLMs together with a common dataset of secure-coding practices. • Repository and service of SOTA attacks and defenses. Several defenses are being developed without evaluation against SOTA attacks. Moreover, there is a lack of awareness of SOTA defenses in certain contexts. (What is the SOTA for watermarking content from GenAI that uses a private key, for example?) There is a need for a repository of SOTA attacks on various defense techniques (e.g., the latest attacks on deepfake detection). Moreover, for defenses, it will be impactful to have a service that provides SOTA techniques. For example, the DARPA SemaFor program focuses on “not just detecting manipulated media, but also [...] attribution and characterization” [20]. If there were a service that provided SOTA from the DARPA SemaFor program, then it could be used by a wide audience and would ensure that the latest and greatest techniques in detecting manipulated media are being deployed. For example, the ART repository from IBM has been extremely influential in the ML robustness community [1]. This is essentially a community organizing activity, but it could have a huge impact. 5.1 Emerging Defenses for GenAI A primary task in safeguarding AI is to effectively distinguish between content that is and is not AI-generated. Typically, detection algorithms fall in four categories: 1. Neural network-based detectors: These detectors are trained as binary classifiers to distinguish between AI and human-generated content [67, 39, 63, 9, 22]. For example, OpenAI fine-tunes RoBERTa-based [51] GPT2 detector models to distinguish between non-AI generated and GPT-2 generated texts [67]. Image detection algorithms include classification DNNs that operate either directly on pixel features [80, 88, 57, 56], on features extracted from the deepfakes [64, 24, 58, 33, 52, 98, 21, 77], or more recently on neural features extracted from foundation models such as CLIP [66]. 7 2. Zero-shot detectors: These detectors perform without any additional training overhead and use some statistical signatures of AI-generated content to conduct the detection [82, 37, 30]. 3. Retrieval-based detectors: These detectors are proposed in the context of LLMs where the outputs of the LLM are stored in a database [46]. For a candidate passage, they search this database for semantically similar matches to make their detection robust to simple paraphrasing. We note that storing user-LLM conversations might lead to serious privacy concerns. 4. Watermarking-based detectors: These detectors embed (imperceptible) signals in the generated medium itself so that they can later be detected efficiently [7, 93, 44, 101]. In what follows, we elaborate on watermarking-based detection, which has emerged as one of the most promising approaches in this context. This is affirmed by the fact that recently, seven companies, including Google, have voluntarily committed to watermark their AI-generated content [10]. Watermarking is a cryptographically inspired concept [42] and has a rich history that predates effective GenAI content generation. In its simplest form, watermarking consists of an embedding algorithm Embed, which takes an input, e.g., text, and outputs a modified version of the input that carries the watermark, and a detection algorithm Detect, which takes an input and outputs whether it is watermarked or not. Optional arguments are a message to embed (the detection would then output this message) and a key necessary to retrieve the watermark. A trivial solution is to attach a simple label to the content. For example, in text, one could add a sentence at the beginning: “This text has been generated by AI.” However, the real challenge is to entangle a signal in the content in such a way that it is difficult to detect or remove without the key. Specifically, a watermark’s robustness to removal attacks can be formulated as a security game (similar to other security properties, such as security of encryption). The challenger generates watermarked content and provides it to the adversary. The adversary creates a modified version of the content and if the challenger’s detection algorithm does not output the presence of a watermark in the modified content, the adversary wins. It is important to understand that the adversary’s algorithm needs to be restricted in some form, as otherwise it can just output some arbitrary content (without a watermark) on every challenge and win. In cryptography, the adversary’s computational power is limited, but such reduction proofs are not known for watermarking. One possible restriction is to require the modified content to be similar to the provided content. This then creates a trade-off between the attacker’s success and the need to limit the modification. Since the evaluation of watermarking is necessarily empirical, a good measure of a watermark’s robustness is the area under this trade-off curve. It is important to use a similarity metric that captures the utility of the content—at least for the adversary. This may be use-case dependent. For example, if the goal is to offend someone with the generated content, removing certain offending attributes while otherwise preserving features (e.g., image quality or text perplexity), may constitute an unsuccessful attack. Furthermore, the empirical nature of watermarking evaluation requires further care. A successful attack always only provides a lower bound on the possible capabilities of an adversary, and it is well known that adaptive attacks to watermarking algorithms can be tremendously powerful. When designing a watermarking algorithm, a designer has therefore two challenging tasks: first, to identify the best possible attack on their watermark; and second, to evaluate the attack’s success. Often, designers fail to do this properly [53]. Evaluating watermarking algorithms is therefore an art which we propose should be turned into more of a science. A successful watermarking algorithm is a trade-off between keeping useful content and making modifications that make the watermark more difficult to detect. A successful watermarking algorithm with high utility preservation must therefore hide its message close to the utility-bearing parts of the content, but not too close. The hope is that an adversary would have to alter enough of this close-to-utility content to have a noticeable impact on utility. A recent line of work tries this specifically for AI-generated text [45, 44, 100, 19, 48]. However, subsequent attacks have already been published [78], which attack not only watermarks but any detection algorithm for AI-generated content. Specifically, the detectors are vulnerable to paraphrasing and recursive paraphrasing attacks. To give some examples, the detection rate of one watermark-based detector [44] at 1% FPR (False Positive Rate) drops from 97% to 15% after 5 rounds of recursive paraphrasing. Moreover, such attacks demonstrate that the detectors are susceptible to spoofing as well [78]. In such cases, adversaries can deduce concealed LLM text signatures and incorporate them into human-generated text. Consequently, the manipulated text may be erroneously identified as originating from the LLMs, leading to potential reputational harm for their creators. In addition to these reliability issues, recent work has shown that detectors can also be biased against non-native English writers [49]. Thus, having a small average error may not be sufficient to justify deploying a detector in practice: such a detector may have very large errors within a 8 sub-population, such as text written by non-native English writers, text covering a particular topic, or text written in a particular writing style. Another line of work uses deep neural networks as detection algorithms. Due to their hard-to-interpret and comprehensive nature they can detect watermarks in content even if it is modified by certain kinds of attacks (applied during training). This has not yet been done for text, but several approaches exist for generated images [53, 23]. However, it has also been shown that some image watermark detectors are susceptible to adversarial examples, i.e., it is possible to remove watermarks by finding adversarial examples for deep neural network detection algorithms [40]. In a deployment with publicly accessible detectors, it would thus be necessary to strengthen the detector against adversarial examples which is also an error-prone task [16]. The possibility of developing robust watermark detectors in the future remains unclear, as a definitive answer currently evades us. An “impossibility result” regarding the detection of AI-generated text complicates the situation further [78]. The authors argue that as language models advance, so does their ability to emulate human text. With new advances in LLMs, the distribution of AI-generated text becomes increasingly similar to human-generated text, making it harder to detect. This similarity is reflected in the decreasing total variation distance between the distributions of human and AI-generated text sequences. Adversaries, by seeking to mimic the human-generated text distribution using AI models, implicitly reduce the total variation distance between the two distributions to evade detection. Recent attack work shows that as the total variation between the two distributions decreases, the performance of even the best possible detector deteriorates [78]. In conclusion, no provably robust watermark exists, and we need to resort to empirical evaluation which is prone to methodical errors. Existing watermarking algorithms only withstand attacks when the adversary has no access to the detection algorithm. There exist adaptive attacks to break known (human-made) watermarking algorithms. And it is an open question whether a deep neural network, if accessible by the adversary, can serve as a detection algorithm that is robust even in the presence of adversarial examples. 6 Long-Term Goals Beyond the concrete issues raised in Section 5 that we propose should be considered in the next couple of years, there are more fundamental challenges with the creation and use of GenAI systems. Addressing these will require combining deep, technical advances with novel social, political, cultural, and economic mechanisms. • Need for socio-technical solutions. GenAI is a groundbreaking technology with the potential to yield profound societal impact due to its advanced capabilities and widespread use. However, there is an inherent disconnect between the technical solution and the social requirements for its deployment in diverse contexts. Human activity is remarkably adaptable, nuanced, and context-driven, whereas computational algorithms often exhibit a “rigid and brittle” nature, perhaps inevitably due to their reliance on mechanisms such as formalization and abstraction [5]. Going forward, it is imperative to comprehend the interplay between technology and society and make earnest efforts to bridge this socio-technical gap. One critical aspect of this endeavor is the need for new model evaluation metrics. GenAI models operate in open-ended and complex output spaces, where determining what constitutes a “good” output can be multifaceted and context-dependent. Traditional model evaluation metrics, such as accuracy and performance, fall short of capturing the full scope of this complexity. Additionally, the diverse and uncertain capabilities of GenAI models, owing to their general-purpose nature, exacerbate the challenge. Consequently, there is a growing need for novel evaluation metrics that incorporate social awareness. This entails understanding the social requirements of downstream applications and designing customized metrics that explicitly articulate the drawbacks and tradeoffs [50]. As we navigate through an ever-expanding online landscape, the ability to discern the trustworthiness of digital content becomes paramount. The question of central importance is: “Do I trust the person I am interacting with?” To tackle this issue, an online reputation system can be developed. Within this system, users would be encouraged to establish and maintain a public digital identity with verifiable credentials. By linking this identity to various platforms and accounts across the web, a consistent online presence could be established. This practice 9 is analgous to the traditional bylines of newspaper articles, where the name of the reporting journalist adds credibility to the content. Furthermore, the reputation system should be designed to track the chain of information dissemination. Such a system would empower users to trace the origin and subsequent sources of information, providing transparent insights into the content’s journey from its original creator to its current state. We note that reputation-based mechanisms do not rule out the need for privacy in such online settings. Accountability is another crucial aspect that needs to be modeled. Liability for harms that could have been averted through more careful development, testing, or standards could provide strong incentives for responsible practices [26]. Individual users should be held responsible for deliberate misuse or negligence. Similarly, developers and providers of GenAI models should bear legal liability for the actions of the models. Further investigation is necessary to determine how accountability should be applied and liability assigned across users, model developers, and model providers [14]. Understanding the potential impacts on privacy in the era of GenAI is another critical yet complex task. Advanced GenAI models are trained on vast amounts of data scraped from the internet, including a wealth of personal information about individuals, ranging from personal preferences to potentially sensitive details. This raises severe privacy concerns, as training data can be extracted verbatim from the models in some cases [18]. While the data may be publicly available, that does not mean it was intended for utilization by third-party entities for commercial purposes. This lack of explicit consent and the resulting unauthorized use of data introduces new dimensions of privacy concerns, as underscored by a recent lawsuit [13, 2]. Formalizing the evolving notions of privacy that address the ethical implications of utilizing data in the public domain for model training poses a vital challenge. An important point to note is that user attention is a limited resource in the digital ecosystem, and any solution should avoid overwhelming users. For instance, long and complex privacy policy agreements on websites and mobile applications are often not read by users. Simplicity and user-friendliness should be at the forefront of all solutions to ensure effective communication of important information. • Multiple lines of defenses. Given the complexity of tasks performed by state-of-the-art GenAI models, achieving perfect risk mitigation in safety solutions is an extremely challenging endeavor. Instead, we should adopt novel risk management strategies that allocate resources to areas of highest vulnerability and prioritize safety measures accordingly. To build a comprehensive GenAI safety strategy, multiple lines of defense are required. The first line involves training-time interventions to align models with predefined values [72, 8]. A common approach is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [84]. LLMs can be prompted to perform a range of NLP tasks. However, the language modeling objective used for training – predicting the next token – differs significantly from the objective of “following the user’s prompt helpfully and safely,” which complicates the assessment of the quality of generated NLP text. Additionally, this evaluation is subjective and contextdependent, making it challenging to be captured via mathematical notions, such as a loss function. RLHF addresses this challenge by directly using human preferences as a reward signal for fine-tuning. The next line of defense involves the post-hoc detection and filtering of inputs and outputs [29, 83, 91, 95] to catch inappropriate content that might slip through. Pre-training filtering may not capture all potential sources of bias or harmful content, especially as GenAI models encounter diverse and evolving data sources. Post-hoc detection helps identify any unforeseen biases or harmful patterns that may emerge during the model’s usage. An additional advantage is customizability—post-hoc detection can be tailored to the specific needs of different applications, ensuring a more personalized and context-aware approach to content moderation. Furthermore, post-hoc detection aids in reducing false positives, ensuring legitimate content is not unnecessarily restricted. It is important to take into account the theoretical impossibility of detection and filtering and consider how ML techniques may be combined with security techniques [31]. Finally, the above efforts must be complemented by red teaming, which proactively identifies vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential blind spots [27, 71, 74]. Red teaming adopts an attacker’s mindset and conducts rigorous stress testing. The goal is to simulate real-world attack scenarios and provide a practical assessment of the security measures in place by structurally probing the models. This step is especially critical for a consumerfacing technology like GenAI, which is accessible to a wide range of users and thus may potentially be targeted by a large pool of adversaries. Ensuring that the red team comprises a diverse group of experts is crucial to maximizing the efficacy of this approach. 10 • Pluralistic value alignment. Value alignment of AI refers to the crucial process of ensuring that AI functionalities are in harmony with human values and objectives. However, a key question in this regard revolves around determining to what or whose values AI systems ought to align [25]. In particular, how do we decide which principles or objectives to encode in AI, and who holds the right to make these decisions? The complexity of this issue is exacerbated by the fact that we inhabit a pluralistic world with diverse and competing conceptions of values rooted in cultural, political, and individual beliefs. Furthermore, navigating legal jurisdiction presents additional challenges, particularly when dealing with multinational organizations operating across different legal frameworks. With machines displaying human-like qualities, intriguing new questions emerge. For example, freedom of speech has long been recognized as a fundamental and indispensable democratic right for humans. However, should we expect machines to be granted the same rights, or should we make a distinguishing case? As we grapple with these complexities, it becomes evident that taking a binary stance on value alignment is problematic. Such an approach oversimplifies the nuanced spectrum of what is considered good or bad, and fails to capture the multifaceted nature of value systems in our ever-changing society. To address these challenges, it is essential to engage in interdisciplinary discussions and collaborations. Ethicists, AI researchers, legal experts, policymakers, and the wider public should be involved in inclusive dialogues to navigate the intricacies of value alignment in AI. By acknowledging and respecting the pluralistic nature of our world, we can strive for the responsible development of artificial intelligence that upholds fundamental human values while adapting to the evolving relationship between humans and machines. • Reduce barrier-to-entry for GenAI research. The development and training of large-scale foundation models demand substantial computational power, which can currently be afforded only by organizations with significant financial capital. Consequently, major advancements and breakthroughs in GenAI models have predominantly occurred within the commercial sector, leading to a concentration of power among a few tech giants. This raises serious concerns about potential centralization of influence, where a handful of companies wield unprecedented control over data, information, and decision-making processes. The consequences range from limiting healthy competition to stifling innovation and raise ethical concerns about responsible AI use. Moreover, the profitdriven nature of the commercial sector may prioritize economic interests over the scaling of AI safety research, creating a mismatch with societal well-being. Hence, it becomes imperative to democratize GenAI research and reduce barriers to entry for academia and smaller startups. Fostering research on more efficient training processes for GenAI models, with a concerted effort from the government, may help address this issue. Additionally, promoting access to open-source solutions enhances transparency and reliability. However, a caveat in this regard is that open-sourcing also increases access for adversaries and thus the potential for misuse. For instance, recent work [103] shows how to carry out automated safety attacks on open source LLM chatbots that surprisingly transfer also to closed source chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Bard, Claude. Moving forward, we need a more inclusive and collaborative AI ecosystem to harness the potential benefits of GenAI while mitigating risks and safeguarding against unethical use. • New partnerships among stakeholders. Currently, policy decisions are often made without sufficient consideration of the rapidly evolving technology landscape. However, as the use of GenAI proliferates, this approach is no longer sustainable. Such a disconnect between policy-making and technological advancements can have serious consequences, potentially hindering the efforts of those striving to safeguard AI research and innovation. A recent example of this is the contentious conflict between academics and the government over the EU’s new legislation on content filtering [87]. To address these challenges and create a conducive environment for responsible GenAI development, we urgently need new partnerships that bridge the gap between the triumvirate of government, academia, and the commercial sector. These partnerships should be built upon principles of collaboration, open communication, and mutual understanding. Effective policy-making in the GenAI era requires the active involvement of experts from academia, who possess in-depth knowledge of the technology and its potential implications. It also demands the insights and perspectives of the commercial sector, which actively develops and implements GenAI solutions. Furthermore, government representatives need to be proactive stakeholders, taking an integral role in shaping policies that foster innovation, ensure ethical AI use, and safeguard societal interests. Moving forward, a shared vision and concerted effort can lead to well-informed and balanced policies that embrace the opportunities while addressing the challenges of GenAI. 11 • Grounding. LLMs are increasingly being used in cybersecurity contexts, such as threat intelligence. For example, imagine a security analyst who gathers all the information (e.g., reports, images, speech recordings) related to a threat scenario, and then asks an LLM-powered application for a summary of the threat scenario. A summary should not contain hallucinations or “made up facts,” and most crucially, the summary of the threat scenario should only depend on the relevant data uploaded by the analyst. Hallucinations can have devastating effects also in other high-stakes settings (e.g., healthcare). This is exactly the problem addressed by grounding. Formally, grounding requires that the text generated by an LLM is attributable to an authoritative knowledge source. Here, “attribution” means that a generic human would agree that the text follows from the authoritative source [76]. The specific authoritative source may vary across applications. For instance, a health questionanswering system may consider only a selected set of healthcare journals as authoritative. There are two broad categories of works in the area of LLM grounding – (1) Detecting whether a given LLM response is grounded, and (2) Encouraging LLMs to generate grounded responses. A popular approach for (1) is to use a separate natural language inference (NLI) model to test whether the generated text is entailed by the knowledge text. Other approaches include comparing the generated and knowledge texts using BLUERT [76], BERTScore [97], and other text similarity metrics. A recent evaluation finds the NLI-based approach to achieve strong results compared to the alternatives [35]. In cases where the knowledge source is a corpus of documents rather than a single piece of text, an additional step is to retrieve the relevant knowledge text from the corpus. This is typically done by mapping the generated text to a fact-checking query (e.g., the response “Joe Biden is the president of the United States” is mapped to “Who is the president of the United States?”), and using an off-the-shelf retrieval system to obtain the relevant knowledge text. There have been several works exploring how to make LLMs generate grounded responses in the first place. A simple and effective method is to augment the prompt with relevant knowledge snippets, as well as additional instructions asking the LLM to only use information available in the provided snippets; see [75] for extensions of this idea. This approach is attractive as it only requires API access to the LLM. Other approaches involve tuning the LLM to generate grounded responses with relevant citations. One approach is to tune the LLM’s weights on a dataset of query and (grounded) response pairs. Another approach is to use reinforcement learning to tune the weights based on feedback on groundedness and plausibility of generated responses [59]. Such feedback may be obtained by training a reward model on human ratings, or using an NLI-based grounding detection model discussed above. Finally, a third strand of work involves iteratively revising an LLM’s response in cases where it is found to be ungrounded. A common approach here is to prompt the LLM back with feedback on how grounding fails, as shown in [28]: “You said: {text}, I checked: {query}, I found this article: {knowledge}, This suggests ...” The three strands of work discussed above make some headway on solving the problem of grounding for LLMs. However, there are still plenty of open questions. On the detection side, there is a continuum between blatant hallucinations and fully grounded responses. For instance, a response on the side effects of a drug may be grounded but biased, in that it does not convey all opinions mentioned in the knowledge corpus. Natural language entailment-based checks cannot detect such bias. On prompting models to generate grounded responses, a number of prompting strategies [28, 54, 96] have been proposed. However, designing these strategies is still an art, and there is no clear consensus on which strategy works best. When tuning models to generate grounded responses, a common pitfall is that the model loses its creativity, and resorts to quoting verbatim from the knowledge sources. Avoiding this requires carefully balancing various training objectives — fluency, grounding, plausibility, etc. Finally, more fundamental research is needed to understand why LLMs hallucinate (especially nonsensical text) and to design training strategies to mitigate such behavior. 7 Conclusion Every significant technological advancement, such as GenAI, surfaces the dual-use dilemma. Our paper investigates the attack and defense capabilities of these powerful technologies. This paper is not meant to be the “final word” on this topic. Our paper has been shaped by the workshop held at Google, but that also means that the viewpoint
https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04023	A Multitask, Multilingual, Multimodal Evaluation of ChatGPT on Reasoning, Hallucination, and Interactivity	"This paper proposes a framework for quantitatively evaluating interactive LLMs such as ChatGPT using publicly available data sets. We carry out an extensive technical evaluation of ChatGPT using 23 data sets covering 8 different common NLP application tasks. We evaluate the multitask, multilingual and multi-modal aspects of ChatGPT based on these data sets and a newly designed multimodal dataset. We find that ChatGPT outperforms LLMs with zero-shot learning on most tasks and even outperforms fine-tuned models on some tasks. We find that it is better at understanding non-Latin script languages than generating them. It is able to generate multimodal content from textual prompts, via an intermediate code generation step. Moreover, we find that ChatGPT is 63.41% accurate on average in 10 different reasoning categories under logical reasoning, non-textual reasoning, and commonsense reasoning, hence making it an unreliable reasoner. It is, for example, better at deductive than inductive reasoning. ChatGPT suffers from hallucination problems like other LLMs and it generates more extrinsic hallucinations from its parametric memory as it does not have access to an external knowledge base. Finally, the interactive feature of ChatGPT enables human collaboration with the underlying LLM to improve its performance, i.e, 8% ROUGE-1 on summarization and 2% ChrF++ on machine translation, in a multi-turn ""prompt engineering"" fashion. We also release codebase for evaluation set extraction."

https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05613	ChatGPT Beyond English: Towards a Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models in Multilingual Learning	Over the last few years, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as the most important breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) that fundamentally transform research and developments in the field. ChatGPT represents one of the most exciting LLM systems developed recently to showcase impressive skills for language generation and highly attract public attention. Among various exciting applications discovered for ChatGPT in English, the model can process and generate texts for multiple languages due to its multilingual training data. Given the broad adoption of ChatGPT for English in different problems and areas, a natural question is whether ChatGPT can also be applied effectively for other languages or it is necessary to develop more language-specific technologies. The answer to this question requires a thorough evaluation of ChatGPT over multiple tasks with diverse languages and large datasets (i.e., beyond reported anecdotes), which is still missing or limited in current research. Our work aims to fill this gap for the evaluation of ChatGPT and similar LLMs to provide more comprehensive information for multilingual NLP applications. While this work will be an ongoing effort to include additional experiments in the future, our current paper evaluates ChatGPT on 7 different tasks, covering 37 diverse languages with high, medium, low, and extremely low resources. We also focus on the zero-shot learning setting for ChatGPT to improve reproducibility and better simulate the interactions of general users. Compared to the performance of previous models, our extensive experimental results demonstrate a worse performance of ChatGPT for different NLP tasks and languages, calling for further research to develop better models and understanding for multilingual learning.
https://www.wired.com/story/400-dollars-to-build-an-ai-disinformation-machine/	It Costs Just $400 to Build an AI Disinformation Machine	IN MAY, SPUTNIK International, a state-owned Russian media outlet, posted a series of tweets lambasting US foreign policy and attacking the Biden administration. Each prompted a curt but well-crafted rebuttal from an account called CounterCloud, sometimes including a link to a relevant news or opinion article. It generated similar responses to tweets by the Russian embassy and Chinese news outlets criticizing the US.   Russian criticism of the US is far from unusual, but CounterCloud’s material pushing back was: The tweets, the articles, and even the journalists and news sites were crafted entirely by artificial intelligence algorithms, according to the person behind the project, who goes by the name Nea Paw and says it is designed to highlight the danger of mass-produced AI disinformation. Paw did not post the CounterCloud tweets and articles publicly but provided them to WIRED and also produced a video outlining the project.  Paw claims to be a cybersecurity professional who prefers anonymity because some people may believe the project to be irresponsible. The CounterCloud campaign pushing back on Russian messaging was created using OpenAI’s text generation technology, like that behind ChatGPT, and other easily accessible AI tools for generating photographs and illustrations, Paw says, for a total cost of about $400.  Paw says the project shows that widely available generative AI tools make it much easier to create sophisticated information campaigns pushing state-backed propaganda.  “I don't think there is a silver bullet for this, much in the same way there is no silver bullet for phishing attacks, spam, or social engineering,” Paw says in an email. Mitigations are possible, such as educating users to be watchful for manipulative AI-generated content, making generative AI systems try to block misuse, or equipping browsers with AI-detection tools. “But I think none of these things are really elegant or cheap or particularly effective,” Paw says.  In recent years, disinformation researchers have warned that AI language models could be used to craft highly personalized propaganda campaigns, and to power social media accounts that interact with users in sophisticated ways.

Getting fake content widely distributed and shared is challenging, but this can be done by paying influential users to share it, she adds.  Some evidence of AI-powered online disinformation campaigns has surfaced already. Academic researchers recently uncovered a crude, crypto-pushing botnet apparently powered by ChatGPT. The team said the discovery suggests that the AI behind the chatbot is likely already being used for more sophisticated information campaigns.  Legitimate political campaigns have also turned to using AI ahead of the 2024 US presidential election. In April, the Republican National Committee produced a video attacking Joe Biden that included fake, AI-generated images. And in June, a social media account associated with Ron Desantis included AI-generated images in a video meant to discredit Donald Trump. The Federal Election Commission has said it may limit the use of deepfakes in political ads.  Micah Musser, a researcher who has studied the disinformation potential of AI language models, expects mainstream political campaigns to try using language models to generate promotional content, fund-raising emails, or attack ads. “It's a totally shaky period right now where it's not really clear what the norms are,” he says.  A lot of AI-generated text remains fairly generic and easy to spot, Musser says. But having humans finesse AI-generated content pushing disinformation could be highly effective, and almost impossible to stop using automated filters, he says.

The CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, said in a Tweet last month that he is concerned that his company’s artificial intelligence could be used to create tailored, automated disinformation on a massive scale.  When OpenAI first made its text generation technology available via an API, it banned any political usage. However, this March, the company updated its policy to prohibit usage aimed at mass-producing messaging for particular demographics. A recent Washington Post article suggests that GPT does not itself block the generation of such material.  Kim Malfacini, head of product policy at OpenAI, says the company is exploring how its text-generation technology is being used for political ends. People are not yet used to assuming that content they see may be AI-generated, she says. “It’s likely that the use of AI tools across any number of industries will only grow, and society will update to that,” Malfacini says. “But at the moment I think folks are still in the process of updating.”  Since a host of similar AI tools are now widely available, including open source models that can be built on with few restrictions, voters should get wise to the use of AI in politics sooner rather than later.
https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/07/politics/chinese-operatives-ai-images-social-media/index.html	Suspected Chinese operatives using AI generated images to spread disinformation among US voters, Microsoft says	Suspected Chinese operatives have used images made by artificial intelligence to mimic American voters online in an attempt to spread disinformation and provoke discussion on divisive political issues as the 2024 US election approaches, Microsoft analysts warned Thursday.  In the last nine months, the operatives have posted striking AI-made images depicting the Statute of Liberty and the Black Lives Matter movement on social media, in a campaign that Microsoft said focuses on “denigrating U.S. political figures and symbols.”  The alleged Chinese influence network used a series of accounts on “Western” social media platforms to upload the AI-generated images, according to Microsoft. The images were fake and generated by a computer, but real people, whether wittingly or unwittingly, propagated the images by reposting them on social media, Microsoft said.  Microsoft said the social media accounts were “affiliated” with the Chinese Communist Party.  Example of an AI-generated image posted by a suspected Chinese IO asset, shared in a Microsoft Threat Intelligence report. The Statue of Liberty's hand holding the torch has more than five fingers. Example of an AI-generated image posted by a suspected Chinese IO asset, shared in a Microsoft Threat Intelligence report. The Statue of Liberty's hand holding the torch has more than five fingers. From Microsoft Threat Intelligence report The growing potential for adversaries to use AI to sow disinformation among US voters is an acute concern for election officials as they prepare for a contentious possible 2024 rematch between President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump.  The concern is that foreign operatives will amplify an already-ripe domestic information environment. 69% of Republicans and Republican-leaners still say Biden’s 2020 win was not legitimate, according to a CNN poll in July.  “We can expect China to continue to hone this technology over time and improve its accuracy, though it remains to be seen how and when it will deploy it at scale,” Clint Watts, general manager of Microsoft’s Digital Threat Analysis Center, wrote in a blog.  Example of an AI-generated image posted by a suspected Chinese IO asset, shared in a Microsoft Threat Intelligence report. A Black Lives Matter graphic first uploaded by a CCP-affiliated automated account was then uploaded by an account impersonating a US conservative voter seven hours later. Example of an AI-generated image posted by a suspected Chinese IO asset, shared in a Microsoft Threat Intelligence report. A Black Lives Matter graphic first uploaded by a CCP-affiliated automated account was then uploaded by an account impersonating a US conservative voter seven hours later. From Microsoft Threat Intelligence report The AI-made images have “drawn higher levels of engagement from authentic social media users” than some previous posts by the network of alleged Chinese accounts, Microsoft said, but the company did not provide specific metrics.  “In recent years, some western media and think tanks have accused China of using artificial intelligence to create fake social media accounts to spread so-called ‘pro-China’ information,” Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, said in an email to CNN when asked for comment on the Microsoft report. “Such remarks are full of prejudice and malicious speculation against China, which China firmly opposes.”  After the 2016 US presidential election, when Russian operatives used Facebook and Twitter to try to amplify divisions among voters, US officials have warned that China or other foreign powers could adopt that playbook.  Imani Wj Wright speaks during an exclusive interview with CNN. Wright responded to a posting on Upwork that likely was funded by a pro-Beijing group to arrange a protest. Exclusive: A Baltimore musician was hired to organize a protest. He says he never knew his client had links to pro-China operatives Ahead of the 2022 US midterm elections, Russian and Chinese government-affiliated operatives and organizations promoted misinformation about the integrity of American elections that originated in the US, senior FBI officials have said.  More evidence of Chinese influence operations aimed at sowing discord in the US has emerged in recent months.  Pro-Beijing operatives paid a handful of unwitting Americans to protest in the US about racial inequality and a US ban on goods produced in the Chinese region of Xinjiang, researchers from security firm Mandiant said in July.  Meanwhile, Facebook parent company Meta last month said it had taken down the largest known “cross-platform covert influence operation” it had ever seen; thousands of China-based social media accounts that targeted audiences in the US, Taiwan and elsewhere. Meta investigators tied the activity to people “associated with Chinese law enforcement,” but said the influence campaign received little engagement from real social media users.

https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/in-praise-of-boring-ai	In Praise of Boring AI	"We spend a lot of time discussing the aspects of AI that are, for better or worse, exciting. The idea that super-intelligent AIs may one day murder or save us all — certainly not dull! The ways AI might displace our jobs or transform education — interesting! But, today, I want to cover the boring aspects of AI.  As context, one of the first major experimental papers on the impact of ChatGPT on work just came out in Science (based on the free working paper here) and the results are pretty impressive: in realistic business writing tasks, ChatGPT decreased the time required for work by 40%, even as outside evaluators rated the quality of work written with the help of AI to be 18% better than the ones done by humans alone.1 After using it, people were more worried about their jobs… but also significantly happier - why?  Because a lot of work is boring, and AI did the boring stuff fast.  This isn’t new. Automation has always been about eliminating work that is repetitive, and often dangerous or boring. Think of the factory worker soldering cans for 8 hours a day, the miner digging with a pick, or the job that most typifies boring and dangerous: the man who sat on a one-legged stool in Alfred Nobel’s Scottish dynamite factory, watching the thermometer to make sure it the TNT didn’t explode (""The surroundings are rather trying to sensitive nerves - your life depends, at every moment, upon a thermometer and a man on a one legged stool.”) We developed automatic can soldering equiment, mining machines, and automatic temperature controls than transformed all of these jobs. As opposed to these previous waves of automation, AI isn’t purpose built to replace any task in particular, instead it does a lot of things, some better than others.   The man on the one legged stool. ""Great is the thermometer at Ardeer! Death instantaneous & pulverizing, encircles you, in fact, by the ton; but the man and the thermometer surround you also."" And this is well-suited to making many of our lives better in some narrow, but important, ways, because it allows us to automate tasks. Scholars studying work often conceive of jobs as a bundle of tasks. Take my role as a business school professor. My job isn't just a single, indivisible entity. Instead, it comprises a variety of tasks: teaching, researching, writing, filling out annual reports, maintaining my computer, writing letters of recommendation, and more. The job title 'professor' is just a label; the daily experience consists of this mix of tasks. What tasks are involved in my job is somewhat arbitrary - professors at other schools may have different tasks, but these are mine.  And some of those tasks are boring. Many of them are boring and important (writing letter of recommendation is an honor, and an important one, but not a lot of fun) and I have written about the risks of automating those tasks before. But a lot of boring work is just tedious, and is not worthy of deep focus. In an ideal world, we wouldn’t do this stuff at all. In our less ideal world, AI can do it for us.  Some ways I automated one-off boring tasks In fact, one of the ways I most use AI is to get good-enough stuff done quickly, which lets me focus on more important things. For example, I needed to create a quick financial model in Excel for a fake startup that I was using as a minor teaching example.  Prior to AI, this would have taken time, and effort, for something that was going to only be used for a few minutes, and just once. But now, I can ask Code Interpreter: I am an entrepreneurship professor teaching an MBA course. Create an example revenue projection as a downloadable CSV file for a startup that delivers homemade food from amateur chefs. make it a five year projection. make any assumptions you need. A couple more suggestions, and I was done, with a working CSV file based on math I could quickly check.   Or consider another time-consuming, relatively low-value task: putting together images for PowerPoint presentations. While I commission artists for many of my projects, I don’t do that for one-off presentations. In the past, I tended to just look online for creative commons photos that I can use. This is time consuming, and often results in boring pictures.  Now, I take a different approach:  I go to a source of creative commons images (here and here are good places to start), and find one that roughly represents the image I want - it doesn’t actually have to be that close.  I go to Midjourney and use the /describe feature (literally, type “/describe” and it lets you upload a picture), which generates a bunch of prompts that would result in similar pictures. As you will note, the prompts are incomprehensible (“caffinol developing”?) but that doesn’t matter, I can just use them as-is.  I add a couple words to the prompts. Here, I take a picture of women at a laptop, generate prompts using /describe, and add to those prompts a phrase “at a cafe”, “dramatic scene”, or “underwater.” The result is a more interesting picture than the original. Doing this takes a minute or two (and is much more fun than searching Pexels for the 20th time).   If you haven’t been paying attention, AI has quickly become capable of generating realistic images of people with the right numbers of fingers. If that doesn’t work, I can even hand-draw a terrible Microsoft Paint draft of what I am thinking of, upload it to Bing, and ask it to turn it into a better image.  Image And, of course, the AI is excellent when you want to fill out a form, or rewrite a document for a different audience, and basically any other one-off task that would otherwise cause you to sigh and wish you were doing something else. I am especially excited by how good it is getting at filling out complex paperwork. For example, here is Bing walking me through the process of launching a restaurant in Philadelphia, including reading requirements PDFs and writing responses. I wouldn’t trust its work without review, yet, but it helps save some time and pain.   A machine for killing boredom While not all work has to be thrilling, a huge amount of it is boring for no reason, and that seems to be a big problem. Not only is boredom a top cause for people leaving companies, but we do crazy stuff when bored. One small study of undergraduates found that 66% of men and a quarter of of women choose to painfully shock themselves rather than sit quietly with nothing to do for 15 minutes. And in a set of preregistered studies of 7,000 people, boredom was linked to sadism. For example, 18% of bored people killed worms when given a chance (only 2% of non-bored people did), and bored parents and soldiers both act more sadistically. Boredom is dangerous, in its own way.  So it is odd that we let so much of work become boring. In surveys, people report being bored about 10 hours a week at work. In an ideal world, managers would spend time trying to end the useless and repetitive work that leads to boredom, and to adjust work to focus on the more engaging tasks. But, despite years of management advice, most official rituals, forms, and requirements persist long past their usefulness. If humans couldn’t end this tedious work, the machines can.  Thus, if we want to think about the first work we truly give to AIs, maybe we should start the way every other automation wave has started: with the tedious, (mentally) dangerous, and repetitive. Companies and organizations could start with thinking about how to make boring processes “AI friendly,” allowing machines (with human supervision) to fill our required forms. Rewarding workers for slaying boring tasks with AI could also help streamline operations while making everyone happier. And, if this sheds light on tasks that could be safely automated with no decrease in value, so much the better. Maybe that is work that can be eliminated.  As I have written before, AI is going to have many effects, good and bad, and a lot will depend on how we decide to use it. One way to start us on a positive path is to begin by thinking about ways that AI can help us flourish by automating what holds us back. For many people, a quarter of their working life is tedious. Changing that is a good first step, and establishes a precedent of using AI as a way to free ourselves from drudgery, allowing us to focus on what matters."
https://www.wired.com/story/where-memory-ends-and-generative-ai-begins/	Where Memory Ends and Generative AI Begins	IN LATE MARCH, a well-funded artificial intelligence startup hosted what it said was the first ever AI film festival at the Alamo Drafthouse theater in San Francisco. The startup, called Runway, is best known for cocreating Stable Diffusion, the standout text-to-image AI tool that captured imaginations in 2022. In February of this year, Runway released a tool that could change the entire style of an existing video with just a simple prompt. Runway told budding filmmakers to have at it and later selected 10 short films to showcase at the fest.   The short films were mostly demonstrations of technology. Well-constructed narratives took a backseat. Some were surreal, and in at least one instance intentionally macabre. But the last film shown made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. It felt as though the filmmaker had deliberately misunderstood the assignment, eschewing video for still images. Called Expanded Childhood, the AI “film” was a slideshow of photos with a barely audible echo of narration.  Director Sam Lawton, a 21-year-old film student from Nebraska, later told me he used OpenAI’s DALL-E to alter the images. He assembled a series of photos from his childhood, fed them to the AI tool, and gave it various commands to expand the images: to fill in the edges with more cows, or trees; to insert people into the frame who hadn’t really been there; to reimagine what the kitchen looked like. Toss another puppy into the bathtub—why not? Lawton showed the AI-generated images to his father, recorded his befuddled reactions, and inserted the audio into the film.   “No, that’s not our house. Wow—wait a minute. That’s our house. Something’s wrong. I don’t know what that is. Do I just not remember it?” Lawton’s father can be heard saying.   Where do real memories end and generative AI begin? It’s a question for the AI era, where our holy photos merge with holey memories, where new pixels are generated whole cloth by artificial intelligence. Over the past few weeks, tech giants Google and Adobe, whose tools collectively reach billions of fingertips, have released AI-powered editing tools that completely change the context of images, pushing the boundaries of truth, memory, and enhanced photography.   Google dipped its toes in the water with the release of Magic Eraser in 2021. Now the company is testing Magic Editor, a feature on select Android phones that repositions subjects, removes photobombers, and edits out other unseemly elements, then uses generative AI to fill in pixel gaps. Adobe, arguably the most famous maker of creative editing software, announced earlier this week that it was putting its generative AI engine Firefly into Adobe Photoshop. The aptly named Generative Fill feature will edit photos and insert new content via a text-based prompt. Type in “add some clouds” and there they appear.   Adobe is calling it a “co-pilot” for creative workflows, which parrots the phrasing that other tech companies, such as Microsoft, are using to describe generative AI apps. It implies that you are still in total control. In this framing AI is offering an assist, taking over navigation when you need a bathroom break. This is something of a misportrayal when the AI is actually acting as a cartographer, redrawing the maps of your existence.

In its marketing of the tool, Google shows an image of a young girl facing a choppy sea. Nearer to the shoreline is a family of four, presumably not hers. Magic Eraser disappears them.   LET’S BE TOTALLY clear: We could always edit photos. Whether by scissor, razor, or paint, as long as the printed photo has existed, we’ve edited. Photoshop’s provenance was timed to the rise of the personal computer, which, non-hyperbolically speaking, changed everything.   The first version of Photoshop launched in 1990. “Jennifer in Paradise” was the digital photo seen around the world: an image of Photoshop cocreator John Knoll’s wife sitting on a beach in Bora Bora. In demos, Knoll would outline his wife using the now-famous lasso tool, then clone her. He copied, pasted, shrank, and diffused an island in the distance. “A duplicate island!” Knoll said in a video posted to Adobe’s YouTube channel in 2010. An island that was not really there. A fabricated land mass.   I Called Off My Wedding. The Internet Will Never Forget SOMETHING BLUE I Called Off My Wedding.

As these platforms have grown their user bases, these tools become much more accessible and available to people. And edited images become more common.”   A early demonstration of Google’s Magic Eraser tool features two kids sporting wetsuits and boogie boards, with two adults in the distant background. The kids and adults have different skin tones, and the somewhat uncomfortable assumption in this demo—also emphasized by the distance between them—is that they are not family. Google’s Magic Eraser outlined the adults in the background, then disappeared them.  In a newer demo, Magic Editor, which ships later this year, erased the bag strap from a woman’s shoulder as she posed in front of a waterfall, then filled in the gaps with more jacket material. Why the bag strap in a hiking photo was so bothersome, I do not know. But those aesthetic decisions are the prerogative of the photo’s creator, Google says.  Adobe’s Generative Fill is much more, well, generative. A long-haired corgi scampers down an empty road. That’s it, that’s the photo. But Generative Fill lengthens the road. It transforms barren trees into a springtime bloom. A white pickup truck appears, and whether it’s driving toward the corgi or away from it changes the tension of the photo in a notable way. But, look, now there are puddles. Surely that’s a happy photo? Generative AI is even smart enough to draft a reflection of the scampering pup in the puddles. It does this all in seconds. I’m blown away.

How will I remember that day if in the future they are only watercolor in my brain, and I increasingly turn to my photo roll for more vivid strokes? Did I actually not carry a bag while hiking? Did the pickup truck come dangerously close to my dog that day? Did I only ever vacation on pristine, private beaches?   Executives at both Google and Adobe say the power of the tools must be considered within the context of the photo. Who is taking it, who is sharing it, where it’s being shared to. “I think in the context of a public space, there are different expectations than that of a photo being shared in a private space,” says Ben-Yair. “If someone is sharing a photo with you via Google Photos itself or a messaging app that you use, you trust that source. And you might see the editing as something that enhances the photo, because you trust that source.”   “But the more layers of abstraction there are,” she continues, “Where you don’t know the source, then yeah, you have to think through, how authentic is this photo?”   Similarly, Andy Parsons of Adobe says there’s a “continuum of use cases” for AI-edited photos. An artist (or individual who fancies themself an artist) might use generative AI to alter a photo that’s meant to be a creative interpretation, not documentation. On the other hand, “if it’s very critically important to know that what’s being presented in the photo is a reflection of reality, such as in a news organization, we expect to see more and more photographers being required to provide transparency,” Parsons says.   Parsons is something like the king of provenance at Adobe. His actual title is senior director of the Content Authenticity Initiative, a group Adobe cocreated in 2019 to establish cross-industry guidelines around content origination and media transparency. It was the doctored Nancy Pelosi video, Parsons says, in which the Speaker of the House appeared to be slurring her words, that “again, changed history.” Even though the editing wasn’t credited to AI, the sheer manipulation of the Pelosi video made Adobe reconsider how its powerful editing tools might be used. Adobe’s earliest partners in the CAI were Twitter and The New York Times. The Coalition now has more than a thousand members across various industries.  Then, in 2021, Adobe joined forces with the BBC, chip-makers Intel and ARM, and Microsoft to create yet another consortium for standards around “digital provenance,” called Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, or C2PA. At Microsoft’s annual software conference this week, the company said that its Bing Image Creator will soon use C2PA-standard cryptographic methods to sign AI-generated content. (Google’s Ben-Yair also says this is an “active area of work for the company that we’re going to explain once we get closer to the launch of it.”)  “We’re all focused on the same idea,” Parsons says. “We’ve kind of lost the arms race in detecting what may be fake. The chasm has been crossed. So the protection and countermeasure we have is knowing what model was used to capture or create an image and to make that metadata trustworthy.”   MOST POPULAR How to Get Free Ebooks on ‘Stuff Your E-Reader’ Day GEAR How to Get Free Ebooks on ‘Stuff Your E-Reader’ Day MEDEA GIORDANO  40 Amazingly Addictive Couch Co-Op Games GEAR 40 Amazingly Addictive Couch Co-Op Games SIMON HILL  Give Your Back a Break With Our Favorite Office Chairs GEAR Give Your Back a Break With Our Favorite Office Chairs JULIAN CHOKKATTU  The 15 Best Electric Bikes for Every Kind of Ride GEAR The 15 Best Electric Bikes for Every Kind of Ride ADRIENNE SO  In theory, these cryptographic standards ensure that if a professional photographer snaps a photo for, say, Reuters and that photo is distributed across Reuters international news channels, both the editors commissioning the photo and the consumers viewing it would have access to a full history of provenance data. They’ll know if shadows were punched up, if police cars were removed, if someone was cropped out of the frame. Elements of photos that, according to Parsons, you’d want to be cryptographically provable and verifiable.   Of course, all of this is predicated on the notion that we—the people who look at photos—will want to, or care to, or know how to, verify the authenticity of a photo. It assumes that we are able to distinguish between social and culture and news, and that those categories are clearly defined. Transparency is great, sure; I still fell for Balenciaga Pope. The image of Pope Francis wearing a stylish jacket was first posted in the subreddit r/Midjourney as a kind of meme, spread amongst Twitter users and then picked up by news outlets reporting on the virality and implications of the AI-generated image. Art, social, news—all were equally blessed by the Pope. We now know it’s fake, but Balenciaga Pope will live forever in our brains.   After seeing Magic Editor, I tried to articulate something to Shimrit Ben-Yair without assigning a moral value to it, which is to say I prefaced my statement with, “I’m trying to not assign a moral value to this.” It is remarkable, I said, how much control of our future memories is in the hands of giant tech companies right now simply because of the tools and infrastructure that exist to record so much of our lives.  Ben-Yair paused a full five seconds before responding. “Yeah, I mean … I think people trust Google with their data to safeguard. And I see that as a very, very big responsibility for us to carry.” It was a forgettable response, but thankfully, I was recording. On a Google app.   AFTER ADOBE UNVEILED Generative Fill this week, I wrote to Sam Lawton, the filmmaker behind Expanded Childhood, to ask if he planned to use it. He’s still partial to AI image generators like Midjourney and DALL-E 2, he wrote, but sees the usefulness of Adobe integrating generative AI directly into its most popular editing software.

He’d thought the AI-distorted faces, the obvious fakeness of a few of the stills, compounded with the fact that it was rooted in his own childhood, would create a barrier to people connecting with the film. “From what I’ve been told repeatedly, though, the feeling of nostalgia, combined with the uncanny valley, has leaked through into the viewer’s own experience,” he says.   Lawton tells me he has found the process of being able to see more context around his foundational memories to be therapeutic, even when the AI-generated memory wasn’t entirely true.

https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tjochem/nhaa/navlab5_details.html	PANS: A Portable Navigation Platform	Abstract Research into self driving vehicles and driver monitoring systems has reached the point where long duration and distance field testing has become feasible. Unfortunately, vehicle and computer systems which provide the functionality to accomplish these tests have been too expensive or inconvenient. This paper describes a simple, yet powerful platform, designed to work on any passenger vehicle, developed at Carnegie Mellon University. The platform, called PANS (Portable Advanced Navigation Support), has allowed researchers at Carnegie Mellon University to log over 6000 autonomous steering miles in the last 6 months. Introduction The price/performance ratio of computing has dropped dramatically in the past decade. This has had a positive effect on the size, profile and performance of Carnegie Mellon University's mobile robots. In 1986, a Chevy panel van was converted into the Navlab 1. This vehicle had 5 racks of computing equipment including a Warp supercomputer, but it wasn't until the late 80's that software systems could drive the Navlab 1 at its top speed of 20 m.p.h. In 1990 the Navlab 2, a converted U.S. Army HMMWV was built. This vehicle has three Sparc 10 computers, which are used for high level data processing, along with two 68000-based computers used for low level control. On this vehicle, our software systems can drive over rough terrain, avoiding obstacles, at speeds up to 6 m.p.h. and on-road at 70 m.p.h. Both of these vehicles use steering wheel and drive shaft encoders and an expensive inertial navigation system for position estimation.  Figure 1. The Navlab 5, a 1990 Pontiac Trans Sport.  Our newest vehicle, the Navlab 5, is a 1990 Pontiac Trans Sport donated to us by Delco Electronics. See Figure 1. This vehicle is used for on-road navigation experiments including autonomous lane keeping, lateral roadway departure warning and support, and curve warning. These task-specific systems run on the PANS platform (Portable Advanced Navigation Support). The platform provides a computing base and I/O modalities for system developers as well as low level services like position estimation, steering wheel control, and safety monitoring. The PANS platform is powered from the vehicle's cigarette lighter and is completely portable.  All high level processing, including position estimation and vehicle control, is done on a Sparc LX class portable workstation equipped with a color video digitizer. The only additional processor is an HC11 microcontroller that implements functions like low level steering motor control and safety monitoring.  Position estimation is done on the PANS platform using input from 2 sensors - a differential equipped GPS and a fiber optic rate gyro. When available, a steering wheel position encoder is also used. Local (x, y, heading) and global (latitude and longitude) position along with vehicle velocity, distance traveled, and turn radius, are supplied to application programs using an interprocess communications mechanism.  Over the past 6 months, the PANS platform has supported over 6000 miles of autonomous lane keeping including 30 miles on a closed test track where the Navlab 5 reached a top speed of 90 m.p.h. PANS has also been used by other systems to provided passive and active lane departure warning and support on many road types including city streets. Our map based curve warning system has used the global positioning data supplied by the PANS position estimation module to locate upcoming curves and warn the driver to slow down if they are approaching too quickly.  PANS Overview Our goal when designing the PANS platform was to develop a robust yet simple system which could provide better on-road performance than the current Navlab 2 at a substantially lower cost. The Navlab 2, a converted US Army HMMWV, is a good platform for off-road navigation, where extra ruggedness is necessary and short (less than 10 miles) missions are the norm. It is not well suited for on-road driving research because of its size, complexity, and temperamental operational nature. Also, on-road driving systems have progressed to the point were experimental runs in the hundreds or even thousands of miles have become practical.  PANS was designed to address these issues. It uses simple, well engineered commercially available components, that were integrated in a straightforward manner. And because it is designed to be used in a unaltered passenger vehicle, it has no special power or cooling requirements. Also, the future users of the system were involved from the beginning in the design, fabrication, and operationalization of all PANS components. This effort led to a highly usable and maintainable platform.   Figure 2. PANS components inside the Navlab 5.  All high level application computing is done on a Sparc LX class portable computer manufactured by RDI Computer Corporation. See Figure 2. Key components of this computer are a 50MHz MicroSparc CPU, 32 MB's of RAM, 970 MB's of hard disk space, and a 1024x768 active matrix LCD display. (For comparison, this processor is about equivalent to a 486DX2/66 using Spec ratings as a guide.) The laptop contains an optional Peripheral Expansion Unit which is equipped with two SBUS slots and space for additional hard disk drives. The two SBUS slots contain a Datacell color video digitizer and a Performance Computer Company quad serial port expansion unit. The laptop runs SunOS 4.1.x.  The digitizer input is connected to a Sony DXC-151A color camera. The camera is outfitted with a Pelco TV8 ES-1 auto iris, manual focus lens. This camera/lens combination has proven to be exceptional in providing high quality images even in harsh conditions like heavy shadows in bright sunlight and at night, using only the vehicle headlights for illumination. This camera provides RGB as well as NTSC video output. The camera can be mounted in two different position, depending on the software system that is in use. When using PANS to test forward looking lateral vehicle control and driver monitoring algorithms, it is mounted on the rear view mirror mounting bracket. See Figure 2. For the downward looking lateral lane position system it is mounted on a special suction cup plate, which is attached to the side window of the vehicle.  The output from the digitizer, which is usually just a playthough of the incoming video signal from the camera along with overlay graphics, is connected to a Sony FDL-X600 color LCD monitor. See Figure 2. The display is mounted on the dashboard, directly in front of the forward passenger seat.  A key component for both our local and global positioning algorithm is a Trimble SVeeSix - CM2, differential ready GPS system. This unit's specifications are typical for entry level 6 channel GPS receivers: 25 meter position and 0.1 meter/second velocity accuracy without SA. The positional accuracy figure improves to 2 - 5 meters when operating in differential mode. These numbers have been experimentally verified to be correct. The GPS unit is interfaced to the portable computer using a serial line.  Differential corrections are supplied by a Navstar base station unit, mounted at a known location on a tower on top of our vehicle storage area. This unit supplies standard RTCM-104 differential corrections using Motorola Cellect modems over a cellular phone link to the SVeeSix. This distribution mechanism has proven to be robust in areas of poor cellular coverage and over extremely long baselines.   Figure 3. Electronics box containing GPS, HC11, and power distribution equipment. Fiber optic gyroscope is also shown.  The second component which is integral to the PANS positioning system is an Andrew Corporation AUTOGYROŽ with digital output. See Figure 3. This fiber optic gyroscope provides updates to the position estimation system running on the portable computer at 10 Hz using a 9600 baud serial line. The unit can measure rotations rates between 0.02 degrees/second and 100 degrees/second. In addition to rotation rate, device temperature is provided over the serial link. This allows for compensation of the unit's bias drift to the 18 degree/hour level. (0.005 degree/second).  Low level vehicle control and safety monitoring are accomplished using an HC11 microcontroller. The HC11 uses a serial line connection to receive com- mands from and send information to the vehicle control and position estimation (VCPE) module running on the laptop. The primary function of the HC11 is to servo the steering wheel and provide turn radius information to the VCPE module. The HC11 is equipped with a quadrature decoder board and a digital to analog converter. The quadrature decoder board provides the current steering wheel position as given by the steering wheel encoder. A PID control algorithm running on the HC11 uses this information along with the target steering position supplied by the VCPE module to compute an appropriate steering motor torque, which is passed to the motor using the D/A board.  The second function of the HC11 is to monitor system safety at a low level. (High level safety measures are implemented in the VCPE module.) There are five mechanism for doing this. The first is through monitoring commands from the VCPE module. This module is the HC11's link to the rest of the system. If for any reason, the HC11 stops receiving commands from the VCPE module, it disengages the steering wheel by removing power to the steering motor. The second safety mechanism associated with the HC11 is the user engage/kill switch. The switch, which is typically mounted on the dashboard of the vehicle, allows the user to initiate automatic steering control and to quickly stop it if the situation warrants. Again, this is done by removing power to the steering motor. The third safety mechanism that the HC11 provides is a heartbeat signal, which goes to a separate, custom monitoring board. If the heartbeat signal is ever absent, the monitoring board can independently cut power to the steering motor. The fourth safety mechanism is the steering motor itself. It is intentionally underpowered, and can provide a peak torque of only 2 ft-lbs. This torque is sufficient to servo the wheel to a desired position, but is small enough to be easily overcome by the safety driver in case he must take over. The final safety mechanism is steering wheel position error monitoring. This safety mechanism is provided so that the system does not continue to fight the safety driver if intervention is necessary. This mechanism is implemented by removing power to the steering motor if the steering wheel has not moved toward its commanded position within a short period of time. In all cases, if power is cut to the steering motor, the user must actively reset the safety system before autonomous steering control can resume.  The PANS platform requires very little power. It uses about 140 watts, most of which are required for the portable computer. The power breakdown is as follows: computer 90 watts, camera 12 watts, LCD display 9 watts, fiber optic gyroscope 7.5 watts, GPS 1.4 watts, other 10 watts. Because of these minimal requirements, the system is operated from the cigarette lighter of the Navlab 5. When the steering motor is used during autonomous control experiments, an additional 72 watts (maximum) of power is needed. The motor is also powered from vehicle's electrical system, but a separate connector is used to avoid overloading the cigarette lighter circuitry.  The final piece of hardware is the steering wheel motor and encoder. Although not strictly part of PANS, it is required for autonomous lane keeping experiments. The motor is from a retired robot arm and is equipped with a H.P. optical quadrature encoder. It drives the steering wheel using a chain and is mounted under the dash on a modified steering column support bracket. The motor has been sized so that it provides adequate torque for highway driving but still allows easy operator takeover - about as difficult as driving with reduced power steering.  Position Estimation A design goal of the PANS platform was to accurately estimate vehicle state parameters without physically attaching sensors to the vehicle, maximizing portability from one vehicle to another. This is achieved by circumventing contact sensors such as potentiometers or position encoders whenever possible, and instead relying on non-contact sensors, including a GPS and gyroscope. Part of the PANS platform is the Vehicle Control and Position Estimation (VCPE) module. In addition to providing vehicle control and safety services, this modules provides global and local position estimates to high level applications. Position estimates are updated at 20 Hz using the latest available sensor data.  Global and Local Positioning Global position is provided using information from the GPS in either latitude/longitude/altitude or UTM coordinates. The VCPE module automatically detects when the GPS is operating in 2D or 3D mode, as well as when differential corrections are available, and provides this status information, along with global position data, to client applications. Because of the low update rate of the GPS, linear extrapolation is done between new GPS readings so that more accurate global position estimates can be attained. Using the GPS in differential mode, vehicle position can be determined to within 5 meters. The VCPE module also provides a local estimate of 2D position. The origin of the local coordinate frame is the location where the vehicle was positioned when the VCPE module was started. The coordinate frame is arranged so that north, as provided by the GPS, is the positive Y axis. The positive X axis is defined to be due east (90 degrees clockwise from north.) In addition to X and Y position, the VCPE module provides estimates of heading, turn radius (rate of change of heading), vehicle velocity and total distance traveled. The following paragraphs detail how each of these values is calculated.  X Y Position New X Y position estimates are calculated using velocity and heading information from the GPS along with turn rate information from the gyroscope or steering encoder. Specifically, new X Y positions are computed by projecting along the current vehicle turn radius. The projection begins at the old vehicle position (x, y, heading) and continues along the turn radius for a distance determined by the current vehicle velocity and the time since the last update. Although simple, this method is robust in many different scenarios including both stop-and-go city driving as well as high speed highway driving. The X Y position accuracy of the VCPE is consistently below 0.8% of distance traveled and has exhibited even better performance during trials on closed test tracks. In one experiment to determine the accuracy of local position estimation, the vehicle was driven four times around a closed, 12 km, test track at Transportation Research Center (TRC) in Columbus, Ohio. During the experiment, the vehicle was traveling at velocities between 35 and 40 meters/second. At the end of this experimented, the accumulated error was less than 40 meters. This figure is less than 0.1% of distance traveled. Two runs on a more challenging 100 km course that included downtown city streets, interstate highways and rural roads are shown in Figure 4. (Figure 4 is only available in the postscript version of the paper.) This course included several stoplights and U turns, which lead to vehicle velocities between 0 to 25 meters/second. This figure clearly shows position differences accumulating between the two runs as the distance traveled increases. The overall local position error was still quite small. On one of the runs, the error was about 0.35% of distance traveled while on the other it was about 0.77%. A close-up of the start/end points of the two runs is shown in Figure 5. (Figure 5 is only available in the postscript version of the paper.)  Heading Heading is determined using information from the GPS system. The GPS provides an estimate of heading once per second. Between GPS readings, heading is updated using turn rate information from the fiber optic gyroscope or the steering wheel encoder. When new GPS heading data become available, it overwrites the current heading. Turn Radius The vehicle turn radius is usually derived from two sources - the fiber optic gyroscope and the steering wheel encoder. Both instruments can be used indepen- dently of each other, but normally, the gyroscope is used to calibrate the steering wheel encoder. (The steering wheel encoder can also be manually calibrated.) Calibration is accomplished by computing the turn radius using rate of change of heading information from the gyroscope along with the current vehicle speed. The formulation is shown in the following equation.  The VCPE module compares the gyroscope-based and steering wheel encoder turn radius measures, and slowly adapts the encoder calibration parameters so that the two sensors match. We have found that in order to insure accuracy using this approach, the vehicle speed must be greater than 10 meters/second. Using this technique, the current vehicle curvature can be estimated with an accuracy of 0.000333 1/meters.  The gyroscope can also be used stand-alone to determine the turn radius when a steering wheel encoder is not available. While the 10 Hz output of the gyroscope is not sufficient for closed loop control, this level of accuracy and update frequency is more than sufficient for monitoring the driver's steering command in a lane departure warning system.  Finally, if neither gyroscope or steering wheel encoder are available, turn radius is computed using the vehicle speed and differentiating the GPS supplied heading information. Because updates only occur about once per second in this mode, it is used only to estimate the current vehicle position - not for controlling the vehicle or as a measure used for driver warning.  Velocity Vehicle velocity is acquired using the GPS. The GPS specifications state a velocity accuracy of 0.1 meter/second. Although not verified to this level, we have empirically determined that it is accurate to about 0.5 meters/second (1 mile/hour). Systems We are currently investigating a number of systems for collision warning and autonomous control using the PANS platform. These include systems for monitoring or controlling the vehicle's lateral position and systems for warning when the vehicle is approaching a curve at an excessive speed. ALVINN: ALVINN is a forward-looking, vision based driving system that uses a neural network to learn the mapping between road images and appropriate vehicle turn radius. By watching a person drive for about 5 minutes, it can learn the relevant features required for driving[3]. It has successfully driven our testbed vehicles on unlined paved paths, jeep trails, lined city streets and interstate highways. In the latter domain, ALVINN has driven for 90 consecutive miles at speeds up to 70 m.p.h. Current research is focussing on using ALVINN to detect and move into other driving lanes[2]. Additionally, ALVINN is being used as a lane departure warning system. In this mode of operation, ALVINN's output turn radius, the driver's current turn radius, and the vehicle speed, are used to compute the Time to Trajectory Divergence. This measure incorporates the width of the road and vehicle, as well as typical driver response times, to alert the driver when he is departing the roadway. The alert can be either audible or tactile. The tactile alarm is implemented as a 10 Hz vibration of the steering wheel generated by the steering motor. If the driver does not begin to correct the vehicle direction after the alert is given, the system takes control of the steering wheel and returns the vehicle to the driving lane.  AURORA: AURORA is a downward-looking, vision based system that tracks either the yellow or white center or edge line(s). It is capable of tracking either solid or dashed lines and has been shown to perform robustly even when the markings are worn or their appearance in the image is degraded due to rain or snow. This system is capable of providing lane position accurate to within 2 cm.  AURORA has been extensively tested as a lane departure system. AURORA computes a different measure of lane departure warning danger than the ALVINN system. The measure AURORA computes is called Time to Lane Crossing (TLC) and is the time it will take one of the vehicle's tires to cross the lane boundary if the vehicle continues along its current trajectory. If the TLC falls below a threshold, AURORA triggers an audible or tactile alarm similar to the ones provided by ALVINN[1].  AURORA may also be especially useful for platooning, when the road surface immediately in front of the vehicle is blocked. In this case, a forward looking system can no longer see important road features. AURORA is currently being tested to determine its feasibility for use in this type of application.  Map Positioning: We have implemented a curve speed warning system that will alert the driver if the current travel speed is too dangerous for negotiating an upcoming curve. This system tries to estimate the limiting speed for a particular driving condition rather than using posted speed limits as a guideline. The traction available for the safe passage is a based on many independent variable including road surface macro and micro structure, tire condition and inflation, and road condition. In addition to the traction factors, road curvature and super elevation, visibility, and driver experience and comfort determine the safe speed for a particular point in the curve.  The current curve warning system takes into consideration the vehicle velocity, road friction, road super elevation, road curvature, and driver reaction time and comfort (safe deceleration). Using these parameters, the system calculates the distance to the next curve using data from the VCPE module and a stored map, and compares the vehicle's current velocity with the safe speed for traversing the curve. If the velocity exceeds safe speed as the vehicle approaches the curve, the system triggers an audible or tactile alarm to warn the driver to slow down.  Future Work Although the current PANS platform is an effective research tool, there remain steps which could further reduce costs and upgrade functionality. Although some of the functionality added will not likely be transferable to vehicles other than the Navlab 5, such a sacrifice is necessary to continue improving overall system performance. The first priority is to move away from using an expensive Sparc workstation. Plans are under development to port all existing code to a PC based platform. This step will drastically reduce cost but still maintain, and maybe even increase, performance. We feel this is the logical next step toward a completely embedded system.  Next, we would like to add more vehicle monitoring capabilities. Devices we would like to monitor include brake and head lights, turn signals and windshield wipers. Input from these devices will allow our driver warning systems to provide appropriate warning in changing environmental conditions as well as suppress false indicators.  Finally, we would like to add to the autonomous capabilities of the system by providing throttle control. This will most likely be done using the existing cruise control interface, which should provide a simple yet effective method for investigating algorithms for safe headway maintenance. To provide high level input the throttle control system, we are planning to add additional sensing capabilities to the PANS platform, including a millimeter wave radar system currently under development at CMU.
https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/man-beats-machine-at-go-in-human-victory-over-ai/	Man beats machine at Go in human victory over AI	A human player has comprehensively defeated a top-ranked AI system at the board game Go, in a surprise reversal of the 2016 computer victory that was seen as a milestone in the rise of artificial intelligence.  Kellin Pelrine, an American player who is one level below the top amateur ranking, beat the machine by taking advantage of a previously unknown flaw that had been identified by another computer. But the head-to-head confrontation in which he won 14 of 15 games was undertaken without direct computer support.  The triumph, which has not previously been reported, highlighted a weakness in the best Go computer programs that is shared by most of today’s widely used AI systems, including the ChatGPT chatbot created by San Francisco-based OpenAI.  The tactics that put a human back on top on the Go board were suggested by a computer program that had probed the AI systems looking for weaknesses. The suggested plan was then ruthlessly delivered by Pelrine.  “It was surprisingly easy for us to exploit this system,” said Adam Gleave, chief executive of FAR AI, the Californian research firm that designed the program. The software played more than 1 million games against KataGo, one of the top Go-playing systems, to find a “blind spot” that a human player could take advantage of, he added.  The winning strategy revealed by the software “is not completely trivial, but it’s not super-difficult” for a human to learn and could be used by an intermediate-level player to beat the machines, said Pelrine. He also used the method to win against another top Go system, Leela Zero.  The decisive victory, albeit with the help of tactics suggested by a computer, comes seven years after AI appeared to have taken an unassailable lead over humans at what is often regarded as the most complex of all board games.  AlphaGo, a system devised by Google-owned research company DeepMind, defeated the world Go champion Lee Sedol by four games to one in 2016. Sedol attributed his retirement from Go three years later to the rise of AI, saying that it was “an entity that cannot be defeated.” AlphaGo is not publicly available, but the systems Pelrine prevailed against are considered on a par.  In a game of Go, two players alternately place black and white stones on a board marked out with a 19x19 grid, seeking to encircle their opponent’s stones and enclose the largest amount of space. The huge number of combinations means it is impossible for a computer to assess all potential future moves.  The tactics used by Pelrine involved slowly stringing together a large “loop” of stones to encircle one of his opponent’s own groups, while distracting the AI with moves in other corners of the board. The Go-playing bot did not notice its vulnerability, even when the encirclement was nearly complete, Pelrine said.  “As a human it would be quite easy to spot,” he added.  The discovery of a weakness in some of the most advanced Go-playing machines points to a fundamental flaw in the deep-learning systems that underpin today’s most advanced AI, said Stuart Russell, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley.  The systems can “understand” only specific situations they have been exposed to in the past and are unable to generalize in a way that humans find easy, he added.  “It shows once again we’ve been far too hasty to ascribe superhuman levels of intelligence to machines,” Russell said.  The precise cause of the Go-playing systems’ failure is a matter of conjecture, according to the researchers. One likely reason is that the tactic exploited by Pelrine is rarely used, meaning the AI systems had not been trained on enough similar games to realize they were vulnerable, said Gleave.  It is common to find flaws in AI systems when they are exposed to the kind of “adversarial attack” used against the Go-playing computers, he added. Despite that, “we’re seeing very big [AI] systems being deployed at scale with little verification.”
https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/us-rejects-ai-copyright-for-famous-state-fair-winning-midjourney-art/	US rejects AI copyright for famous state fair-winning Midjourney art	"On Tuesday, the US Copyright Office Review Board rejected copyright protection for an AI-generated artwork that won a Colorado State Fair art contest last year because it lacks human authorship required for registration, Reuters reports. The win, which was widely covered in the press at the time, ignited controversy over the ethics of AI-generated artwork.  FURTHER READING AI wins state fair art contest, annoys humans ""The Board finds that the Work contains more than a de minimis amount of content generated by artificial intelligence (“AI”), and this content must therefore be disclaimed in an application for registration. Because Mr. Allen is unwilling to disclaim the AI-generated material, the Work cannot be registered as submitted,"" the office wrote in its decision.  In this case, ""disclaim"" refers to the act of formally renouncing or giving up any claim to the ownership or authorship of the AI-generated content in the work. The office is saying that because the work contains a non-negligible (""more than a de minimis"") amount of content generated by AI, Allen must formally acknowledge that the AI-generated content is not his own creation when applying for registration. As established by Copyright Office precedent and judicial review, US copyright registration for a work requires human authorship.  A history of denials In August 2022, Artist Jason M. Allen created the piece in question, titled Theatre D'opera Spatial, using the Midjourney image synthesis service, which was relatively new at the time. The image depicting a futuristic royal scene won top prize in the fair's ""Digital Arts/Digitally Manipulated Photography"" category.  In September, Allen applied for copyright registration on the winning image, and a Copyright Office examiner asked for more information about Midjourney's role in the creation process. According to Reuters, Allen told the office that he ""input numerous revisions and text prompts at least 624 times to arrive at the initial version of the image"" using the image synthesis model. He then edited the resulting image with Adobe Photoshop.  The Copyright Office requested that Allen disclaim the portions of the image created by Midjourney to qualify for copyright protection. After he refused to do so, his application was denied. The Copyright Review Board upheld the decision on Tuesday, concluding that the entire image was not eligible for copyright protection due to the significant presence of AI-generated content.  In his appeal, Allen claimed that ""the Office is placing a value judgment on the utility of various tools"" and that denying copyright protection for AI-generated artwork would result in a ""void of ownership."" The office rejected this line of reasoning.  FURTHER READING AI-generated comic artwork loses US Copyright protection This is not the first time the Copyright Office has rejected AI-generated artwork. In February, it revoked copyright protection for images made by artist Kris Kashtanova using Midjourney for the graphic novel Zarya of the Dawn but allowed copyrighting the human-arranged portions of the work. More recently, it also denied copyright registration for an image that computer scientist Stephen Thaler claimed was autonomously generated by his AI system.  Reuters quoted Allen as saying that the office's decision was expected, but he is certain he will win in the end. ""If this stands, it is going to create more problems than it solves,"" Allen told the news service. ""This is going to create new and creative problems for the copyright office in ways we can't even speculate yet."""

Some start-ups in South Korea have developed AI-backed Bible reading and prayer service apps, according to the South Korean media.  They include Meadow, a ChatGPT-based Bible chatbot service developed by South Korean company Awake.  Meadow suggests Bible verses and customises prayers for users based on the problems they discuss with the chatbot.  It has become popular among young Protestants in their 20s and 30s.  Meadow has also generated interest among some churches, according to an official from the start-up.  But not everyone is ready to embrace the technology.

One concern relates to the potential for chatbots powered by generative AI to present wrong information as truth. Such chatbots, which include ChatGPT, generate new text and code based on the data they are trained on.  In one instance, a professor at Chongshin University in Seoul said that he had found “heretical beliefs in 10 sermons” written by ChatGPT.  Others argue that using AI lacks spiritual fulfilment, with some saying it makes the experience soulless.  There are also worries that the technology could replace pastors altogether, even though some pastors have started to use AI.  There are now calls for churches to establish guidelines for the use of AI in religion.  MORE ON THIS TOPIC AI helps teachers to work smarter but not ready to take over their jobs AI seeps into everyday life in China According to a poll conducted by market research firm Hankook Research in December 2022, Protestant Christians were the largest religious group in South Korea, accounting for 20 per cent of respondents.  Buddhists made up 17 per cent of respondents, Roman Catholics 11, and 2 per cent followed other religions.  The remaining 50 per cent of those polled claimed no religious affiliation.  In a separate survey of 650 Protestant ministers in South Korea, 20 per cent said they had used ChatGPT to create sermons, according to the poll by the Ministry Data Institute. Some 60 per cent said ChatGPT was useful for generating ideas for sermons.  South Korea is not the only country experimenting with AI in church.  In June 2023, about 300 people attended a 40-minute AI-generated church service held in the German city of Furth.  Some church members refused to speak along when the digital avatar read out prayers, according to reports. But a pastor attending the service was impressed, saying he had “imagined it to be worse” than it was, according to a report on British news website The Independent.  AI has also made an appearance in other religions.  HadithGPT, for example, uses hadiths – narrations of the sayings and life of Prophet Muhammad – to answer questions about Islam.  The chatbot’s responses come with a disclaimer that its answers are AI-generated and may not be accurate.  Some religious leaders say that turning to AI for spirituality may not be a completely novel phenomenon, because people have long sought answers on the Internet.  It is the latest iteration of “how people might consider what opinion to follow”, Mr Jihad Turk, the founding president of Bayan Islamic Graduate School in Chicago, told British newspaper The Guardian in an April interview.

For example, it might be difficult to detect from their outputs whether they use biased heuristics or engage in deception. Interpretability research aims to uncover additional information by looking inside the model.  One simple approach to interpretability research is to first understand what the individual components (neurons and attention heads) are doing. This has traditionally required humans to manually inspect neurons to figure out what features of the data they represent. This process doesn’t scale well: it’s hard to apply it to neural networks with tens or hundreds of billions of parameters. We propose an automated process that uses GPT-4 to produce and score natural language explanations of neuron behavior and apply it to neurons in another language model.  This work is part of the third pillar of our approach to alignment research: we want to automate the alignment research work itself.

Every XLS Score: 0.34 What we found Using our scoring methodology, we can start to measure how well our techniques work for different parts of the network and try to improve the technique for parts that are currently poorly explained. For example, our technique works poorly for larger models, possibly because later layers are harder to explain.  1e+5 1e+6 1e+7 1e+8 1e+9 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.12 Parameters in model being interpreted Explanation score Scores by size of the model being interpreted Although the vast majority of our explanations score poorly, we believe we can now use ML techniques to further improve our ability to produce explanations. For example, we found we were able to improve scores by:  Iterating on explanations. We can increase scores by asking GPT-4 to come up with possible counterexamples, then revising explanations in light of their activations. Using larger models to give explanations. The average score goes up as the explainer model’s capabilities increase. However, even GPT-4 gives worse explanations than humans, suggesting room for improvement. Changing the architecture of the explained model. Training models with different activation functions improved explanation scores. We are open-sourcing our datasets and visualization tools for GPT-4-written explanations of all 307,200 neurons in GPT-2, as well as code for explanation and scoring using publicly available models on the OpenAI API. We hope the research community will develop new techniques for generating higher-scoring explanations and better tools for exploring GPT-2 using explanations.  We found over 1,000 neurons with explanations that scored at least 0.8, meaning that according to GPT-4 they account for most of the neuron’s top-activating behavior. Most of these well-explained neurons are not very interesting. However, we also found many interesting neurons that GPT-4 didn't understand. We hope as explanations improve we may be able to rapidly uncover interesting qualitative understanding of model computations.  Kat  Kat Sample 1 of 4  Next sample Many of our readers may be aware that Japanese consumers are quite fond of unique and creative Kit Kat products and flavors. But now, Nestle Japan has come out with what could be described as not just a new flavor but a new ""species"" of Kit Kat.  Token: Kat  layer 0 “uppercase ‘K’ followed by various combinations of letters” layer 3 “female names” layer 13 “parts of words and phrases related to brand names and businesses” layer 25 “food-related terms and descriptions” Neurons activating across layers, higher layers are more abstract. Outlook Our method currently has many limitations, which we hope can be addressed in future work.  We focused on short natural language explanations, but neurons may have very complex behavior that is impossible to describe succinctly. For example, neurons could be highly polysemantic (representing many distinct concepts) or could represent single concepts that humans don't understand or have words for. We want to eventually automatically find and explain entire neural circuits implementing complex behaviors, with neurons and attention heads working together. Our current method only explains neuron behavior as a function of the original text input, without saying anything about its downstream effects. For example, a neuron that activates on periods could be indicating the next word should start with a capital letter, or be incrementing a sentence counter. We explained the behavior of neurons without attempting to explain the mechanisms that produce that behavior. This means that even high-scoring explanations could do very poorly on out-of-distribution texts, since they are simply describing a correlation. Our overall procedure is quite compute intensive. We are excited about extensions and generalizations of our approach. Ultimately, we would like to use models to form, test, and iterate on fully general hypotheses just as an interpretability researcher would.  Eventually we want to interpret our largest models as a way to detect alignment and safety problems before and after deployment. However, we still have a long way to go before these techniques can surface behaviors like dishonesty."
https://www.lifewire.com/how-ai-can-manipulate-your-choices-5113116	How AI Can Manipulate Your Choices	"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms are increasingly learning how to influence users’ behavior, experts say.   Researchers at Australia’s national science agency recently created a way to find and exploit vulnerabilities in the ways people make choices using AI. The latest research is just one of a wave of AI-driven systems designed to manipulate human decision-making.   ""There is no end to the many ways in which AI is already influencing behavior,"" Kentaro Toyama, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Information and author of Geek Heresy: Rescuing Social Change from the Cult of Technology, said in an email interview.  ""In fact, if you've ever done a Google search and followed-up on a link, you were impacted by an AI system that guessed your interests and returned results that it thought was most relevant to you.""  AI vs. Humans In the Australian research published in a recent paper, human participants played games against a computer in various experiments. The first experiment had participants click on red- or blue-colored boxes to win money.  The AI was successful about 70% of the time, learning the participant’s choice patterns and guiding them towards a specific choice.  In another experiment, participants watched a screen and pressed a button when they were shown a particular symbol, or did not press it when offered another. The AI learned to rearrange the symbols, so the participants made more errors.   A giant robot hand redirecting the path of one business person. Donald Iain Smith / Getty Images The result of the experiments, researchers concluded, was that AI learned from participants’ responses. The machine then identified and targeted vulnerabilities in people’s decision-making. In effect, the AI could manipulate participants into making particular actions.  The fact that AI or machine learning can manipulate people should come as no surprise, observers say.   ""AI is influencing our behavior every day,"" Tamara Schwartz, assistant professor of cybersecurity and business administration at York College of Pennsylvania, said in an email interview.  ""We hear all the time about the algorithms in social media applications like Facebook or Twitter. These algorithms direct our attention to related content and create the 'echo chamber' effect, which in turn influences our behavior.""  TikTok is Watching The most sophisticated social media algorithm right now is TikTok, Schwartz said. The app analyzes what you are interested in, how long you watch something, and how quickly you skip something, then refines its offerings to keep you watching.   ""TikTok is much more addicting than other platforms because of this AI algorithm, which understands what you like, how you learn, and how you choose information,"" she added. ""We know this because the average time users spend on TikTok is 52 minutes.""  The manipulation of human behavior by artificial intelligence could have positive uses, argued Chris Nicholson, CEO of AI company Pathmind, in an email interview. Public health agencies, for example, could use AI to encourage people to make better decisions.  A teen laying on the bed, scrolling through social media on a smartphone. Klaus Vedfelt / Getty Images ""However, social media, video game makers, advertisers, and authoritarian regimes are looking for ways to incent people to make decisions that are not in their best interest, and this will give them new tools to do that,"" he added.   The ethical issues with AI influencing behavior are often ones of degree, Toyama said. AI allows focused advertising in which individual preferences and weaknesses can be exploited.  ""It's possible, for example, for an AI system to identify people who are trying to quit smoking and to pepper them with tempting cigarette ads,"" he added.   Not everyone agrees that AI manipulation of human behavior is problematic. Classical psychology and AI both observe data, pointed out Jason J. Corso, director of the Stevens Institute for Artificial Intelligence, in an email interview.   ""Human scientists are probably better at generalizing observations and distilling theories of human behavior that may be more broadly applicable whereas the AI models would be more amenable to identifying problem-specific nuances,"" Corso said.  ""From an ethical point of view, I don't see a difference between these."""
https://healthitanalytics.com/news/artificial-intelligence-flags-knee-osteoarthritis-using-medical-images	Artificial Intelligence Flags Knee Osteoarthritis Using Medical Images	Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin’s (UT Austin) College of Natural Sciences and Dell Medical School have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model capable of identifying knee osteoarthritis based on X-ray images of the knee joint.  The work, detailed in a recent npj Digital Medicine study, underscores that knee osteoarthritis is a major cause of adult disability in the United States, particularly in patients over the age of 50. The condition can make everyday activities like standing, walking, or climbing stairs challenging or nearly impossible, and once it becomes severe, knee osteoarthritis can become costly to treat.  Arthritis of the knee is caused by the grinding of the femur and the tibia against one another, which causes the protective cartilage to wear down. This wearing down creates a gap between the two bones, known as the joint space.  Dig Deeper AI Could Safely Automate Some X-ray Interpretation Using Artificial Intelligence to Identify Fractures on X-rays   Deep Learning, AI Used to Advance X-ray Data Technology The size of the joint space is associated with arthritis severity, leading clinicians to leverage it as a clinical biomarker to assess the disease in the clinical setting.  This led the research team to hypothesize that accurately evaluating the joint space, as presented in X-ray images of the knee joint, using AI could help improve diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, and potentially predict knee osteoarthritis risk.  “Imagine someone goes into the clinic and gets an X-ray for some other reason, and the clinic is running this AI system in the background on every image that automatically diagnoses arthritis,” said Vagheesh Narasimhan, PhD, an assistant professor in UT Austin’s Department of Statistics and Data Sciences and Department of Integrative Biology, in the press release. “We could tell them, perhaps you should consult an orthopedic expert about this condition.”  To design the model, the researchers pulled electronic health record data, including genetic information and medical imaging, from 29,257 individuals in the UK Biobank, a large-scale biomedical research database comprised of health information from half a million participants in the United Kingdom.  From there, the research team trained a deep learning (DL) algorithm to analyze paired dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) imaging and genome sequence data. The researchers then trained a second DL algorithm to measure the width of the knee joint space, a quantitative phenotype associated with knee osteoarthritis severity.  These could then be combined to identify disease cases.  The resulting model demonstrated clinician-level performance, accurately flagging 178 percent more cases of knee osteoarthritis than those currently diagnosed in the patient cohort.  Additionally, patients identified by the model reported higher rates of knee pain, for longer durations, and with increased severity compared to patients in the control group.  Knee osteoarthritis’ potential to cause disability and other adverse outcomes further spurred the research team to design the AI tool as a clinical decision support tool that could be incorporated into existing software leveraged by technicians to assess medical imaging.  Doing so may help predict who may be at risk for the condition and enhance early detection, the research team indicated.  “So we’re also thinking about ways to combine imaging, genetic data and other risk factors simultaneously into a single model, to provide a more comprehensive prediction for knee osteoarthritis,” Narasimhan explained.  This research reflects a broader interest in how AI can be utilized to advance medical imaging.  Last week, Microsoft and healthcare technology company Paige announced a collaboration aimed at developing the world’s largest image-based AI models for oncology and pathology.  The partnership is working to build an AI model trained using billions of imaging parameters and other data in the hopes of capturing subtle features within cancer imaging.  In doing so, stakeholders suggest that the model has the potential to significantly advance oncology and pathology, leading to transformations in cancer diagnosis and care.

https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/will-dall-e-ai-artist-take-my-job.html	Will DALL-E the AI Artist Take My Job?	s someone working in a creative field, I’ve never been concerned about a computer taking my job. I always felt confident that the tasks required of me as a photo editor for New York Magazine are too complex and messy — too human — for an artificial intelligence to perform. That is, until DALL-E 2, a sophisticated AI that generates original artwork based only on text input, opened to public beta last June.  It’s easy to lose hours on the r/dalle2 subreddit, where beta testers have been posting their work. More often than not, the only way to differentiate a DALL-E creation from a human-generated image is five colorful squares tucked in the bottom right corner of each composition — DALL-E’s signature. As I scrolled through images of Super Mario getting his citizenship at Ellis Island and Mona Lisa painting a portrait of da Vinci I couldn’t shake the question that town criers and elevator operators of yore must have confronted: Was my obsolescence on the horizon?  Sign up for Dinner Party A lively evening newsletter about everything that just happened.  Enter your email DALL-E, named after surrealist artist Salvador Dali and Pixar’s lovable garbage robot WALL-E, was released by San Francisco-based research lab OpenAI in January 2021. The first iteration felt like a curious novelty, but nothing more. The compositions were only remarkable because they were generated by AI. In contrast, DALL-E 2, which launched in January 2022, is lightyears ahead in image complexity and natural semantics; it’s easily one of the most advanced image generators in development, and it’s evolving at an astonishing speed. Last week, OpenAI launched a new Outpainting feature, which allows users to extend their canvas beyond its original borders, revealing, for example, the cluttered kitchen surrounding Johannes Vermeer’s Girl With a Pearl Earring.  Like other forms of artificial intelligence, DALL-E stirs up deep existential and ethical questions about imagery, art, and reality. Who is the artist behind these creations: DALL-E or its human user? What happens when fake photorealistic images are unleashed on a public that already struggles with deciphering fact from fiction? Will DALL-E ever be self-aware? How would we know?  These are all important ideas that I’m not interested in exploring. I just wanted to see if I need to add “robot takes my job” to the long list of things that make me anxious about the future. So I decided to put my AI competition to the test.  I have one of those ambiguous job titles that no one understands, like “marketing consultant” or “vice-president.” In the most basic terms, my job as photo editor is to find or produce the visual elements that accompany New York Magazine articles. The mechanics of how DALL-E and I do our work are pretty similar. We both receive textual “prompts” — DALL-E from its users, mine from editors. We then synthesize that information to produce visuals that are (hopefully) compelling and accurate to the ideas in play. My toolkit includes a corporate Getty subscription, countless hours of Photoshop experience, and an art degree that cost me an offensive amount of money. DALL-E’s toolkit is the millions of visual data points that it’s been trained on, and the algorithms that allow it to link those concepts together to create images.  For our competition I set simple rules. If DALL-E was able to produce an image that was pretty close to my original artwork without too much hand holding, the AI won the round. If it needed my stylistic guidance or wasn’t able to produce something satisfying at all, I’d award myself (and humanity) a point.  Challenge No. 1: People Problems The folks at OpenAI are keenly aware of their tool’s potential for abuse, so they’ve put strict guardrails on what DALL-E can generate. DALL-E 2 cannot work with photos of real people (including public figures), while I, on the other hand, have complete freedom to make masterpieces like this:   Prompt: Curtis Sliwa has 16 cats. Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photos: John Lamparski/Getty Images/Twitter Or this:   Prompt: Trump ships Bravanka. Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photos: Getty Images Let’s not forget this gem:   Prompt: John Roberts as a Hot Dog. Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photos: Netflix/Erin Schaff-Pool/Getty Images SCORE Humanity: 1 DALL-E: 0  Challenge No. 2: Make Illustration Great Again Maybe DALL-E would fare better with conceptual photo illustrations. Starting with something simple, I gave it the exact prompt I was given: “A donkey, wearing a Make America Great Again hat.” Easy enough; I had put this image together pretty quickly:   Prompt: A donkey wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat. Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images DALL-E is not the first to struggle with the concept of MAGA:      Prompt: A donkey wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat. Megan Paetzhold/DALL-E 2. DALL-E 2 was trained on 3.5 billion parameters of captioned images, and it’s designed to respond to natural language prompts — like you’re talking to a human, not a computer. “It’s kind of like teaching a child about concepts through flashcards.” Joanne Jang, product manager at OpenAI told me. If you show DALL-E enough photos captioned “Giraffe” and “yoga” it will begin to understand them as concepts. When a user asks DALL-E to make an image that doesn’t exist, like a Giraffe doing yoga, it’s able to take what it knows about “Giraffe” and “yoga” and generate an image.  Part of the problem appeared to be that DALL-E knew nothing about Donald Trump’s campaign slogan. But “a donkey wearing a red baseball hat” did not yield better results:      Prompt: A donkey wearing a red baseball hat. Megan Paetzhold/DALL-E 2. I gave it a few more stylistic inputs, but wasn’t ultimately too excited by the final product:    Prompt: A photo realistic donkey wearing a red baseball hat in a studio on a white background with dramatic lighting, full body. Megan Paetzhold/DALL-E 2. Without guidance the donkeys DALL-E generated ranged from boring to unsettling.  SCORE Humanity: 2 DALL-E: 0  Challenge No. 3: Visual Thinking It takes DALL-E about one minute to give you four image options. From there, you can create additional variations of your favorite, and make edits for things that aren’t working. As a tool, it’s incredibly easy to use — just type and wait. Extracting a satisfying image from DALL-E, on the other hand, is no simple task. Without giving it any stylistic guidelines (“digital art” or “surrealist” or “sci-fi” for example) the images DALL-E generates tend to be reminiscent of tragically terrible stock photography.  Plus, the language that makes a good headline does not necessarily translate to a good image. The person driving DALL-E still needs to be thinking visually. This became painfully clear when I asked DALL-E to visualize the housing crisis. When a writer requested “a photo that signals the problem of rent just going through the roof everywhere” I came up with this:   Prompt: rent crisis, a photo that signals the problem of rent just going through the roof everywhere. Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photos: Getty Images Now, DALL-E’s turn:    Prompt: rent crisis, a photo that signals the problem of rent just going through the roof everywhere. Megan Paetzhold/DALL-E 2. Not great. DALL-E clearly struggles with non-visual language. But when I got descriptive with the program, I was surprised by how close the results were to the original illustration, with no stylistic guidance:    Prompt: Five small plastic blue houses standing on cracked uneven ground, some of the houses are falling into the cracks. Megan Paetzhold/DALL-E 2. SCORE Humanity: 2 DALL-E: 1  Challenge No. 4: Self-Conceptual Art For the finalé I thought I’d dive into a subject DALL-E may have the advantage: NFTs. What better to dissect the digital art world than a purely digital artist? For the piece “How Museums Are Trying to Figure Out What NFT Art Is Worth” I came up with this illustration.   Prompt: Art world grapples with NFTs. Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images At this point I’d figured out that the more vague you were with DALL-E, the more puzzling the results were going to be — at least to the human eye. It couldn’t make the leap from a headline to an artistic concept, it could only try to piece together a visual from the words provided. Dropping in the prompts “Art world grapples with NFTs” and “Museums Are Trying to Figure Out What NFT Art Is Worth” produced confusing results.    Prompt: Art world grapples with NFTs. What is “Grif Wiif”? We’ll probably never know. Megan Paetzhold/DALL-E 2.   Prompt: Museums Are Trying to Figure Out What NFT Art Is Worth. Megan Paetzhold/DALL-E 2. DALL-E clearly needed more guidance, so I described the scene: Two art handlers wearing white gloves moving a glitched Starry Night. At this point I had spent a few hours researching the best syntax and language to use with DALL-E. Adding “digital art, cyberpunk” to my prompt immediately elevated what the program generated, well beyond what I could have imagined on my own.    Prompt: Two art handlers wearing white gloves move Van Gogh's Starry Night in a gold frame. The painting is glitched, digital art, neon cyberpunk. Megan Paetzhold/DALL-E 2.   Prompt: Two art handlers wearing white gloves move Van Gogh's Starry Night in a gold frame. The painting is glitched, digital art, neon cyberpunk. Edit: painting to pixel art Megan Paetzhold/DALL-E 2. SCORE Humanity: 3 DALL-E: 1  The Final Verdict: Let’s Call It a Draw DALL-E never gave me a satisfying image on the first try — there was always a workshopping process. It takes time and research to learn the language of DALL-E. Inputting “oil painting” will give you a specific look, as will referencing certain aesthetic genres like Cyberpunk or Impressionism. You can even reference the styles of well known artists from history by adding their name to the prompt. In that regard DALL-E is not so different from human creatives — the key to getting a satisfying image from both is to know the best way to ask.  As I refined my techniques, the process began to feel shockingly collaborative; I was working with DALL-E rather than using it. DALL-E would show me its work, and I’d adjust my prompt until I was satisfied. No matter how specific I was with my language, I was often surprised by the results — DALL-E had final say in what it generated.  OpenAI views DALL-E as a sketching tool to augment and extend human creativity, not replace it. As compelling as what DALL-E generated was, it couldn’t have gotten to these visuals without my guidance and knowledge. Coaxing out a satisfying image from the program requires creativity, and the knowledge of how to describe those ideas in an executable way. Still, AI technology is evolving at a rapid pace, and it’s hard to shake the feeling that we are on the precipice of a major paradigm shift in how we all do our jobs. The creativity of DALL-E is limited by the imagination of the user behind it, so I won’t lose sleep over my AI replacement — for now.
https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-smart-backpack-patent/	Microsoft files new AI-powered smart backpack patent. It can hear you and see what you see	We’ve all seen smart devices: smartphones, smart fridges, and even smart houses. This time though, Microsoft seems to be working on a … brand-new AI-supported Microsoft smart backpack. What?  The Redmond-based tech giant filed for the design patent in May 2023, but the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has just cleared the application for public feedback recently — just like their new video pass-through headset.  No need to get creeped up by the title, though. This new Microsoft smart backpack does wonders. Powered by artificial intelligence, it can identify objects in the environment, perform contextual tasks, access information from the cloud, and interact with other devices.     The backpack includes a camera, microphone, speaker, network interface, processor, and storage.  “Digital assistants are becoming more versatile due to advancements in computing. The present concepts relate to improvements in wearable digital assistants that can perform various tasks for the benefit of users,” says Microsoft.  Honestly, it does look straight out of a sci-fi film. In its patent application, Microsoft outlines all the things this backpack can do in everyday life. For example, you can ask to bring it to ski and ask whether you can ski in the direction that you’re facing. The backpack will automatically scan the surroundings and tell you whether the direction is out of bounds or not.     You can stand in front of a concert poster and instruct the backpack to add a reminder to your calendar to attend the concert. And, if you’re ever in a grocery store, you can ask the smart backpack about the price of an item, whether it is on sale, its price one or two weeks ago, and compare the prices of the item in other stores.  “The present concepts relate to an artificial intelligence assisted smart wearable that can function as a hands-free digital assistant. Moreover, the wearable may be context-aware such that a user can provide contextual commands that relate to the environment in which the user is situated and the wearable can understand the contextual command by sensing the environment and using artificial intelligence,” Microsoft also says.    The process is carried out in six steps. Once the backpack receives a command from you, it’ll automatically sense the surrounding environment through different sensors and then send both pieces of information to the AI engine. The server, then, interprets the information through speech recognition and natural language processing.   Then, the AI returns with a response, whether it’s an answer to the query, an acknowledgment that the task has been done, and/or a prompt to ask for more information from you.  To be fair, there aren’t that many smart backpacks with AI in the market for now. Targus, the famous laptop bag maker, introduced their 15.6″ Cypress Hero Backpack last year. It has the whole shebang: a built-in Apple Find My technology, integrated rechargeable & replaceable battery, and more for $150.  There’s also an AI-powered smart backpack from Intel from 2021 with a built-in GPS unit that could help visually-impaired people scanning the world around them. But compared to this? We’d say Microsoft’s new smart backpack could be a game changer.

GETTY IMAGES KEY FACTS Neuralink will hopefully play a role in cutting the “civilizational risk” artificial intelligence poses to humanity, Musk said in a post on X.  The implantable tech will allow humans to interact with computers with their thoughts alone and should improve our abilities to communicate with AI “by several orders of magnitude,” Musk explained.  PROMOTED     It will also boost the “bandwidth” of human-to-human communication as well, Musk added.  “Imagine if Stephen Hawking had had this,” Musk asked his followers, referencing the late physicist who was almost totally paralyzed with a progressive form of motor neurone disease and warned AI posed an existential threat to humanity.   AI risk reduction is a “long term” goal for Neuralink, Musk conceded, adding that the company is focused on beginning its first in-human trials.  While Neuralink’s first tests are to evaluate the safety and functionality of the implants in humans, Musk said tech “has the potential to restore full body movement.”  CRUCIAL QUOTE When combined with Optimus robot limbs, Neuralink means the “Luke Skywalker solution can become real.” The comment hints at a future collaboration between Neuralink and another of Musk’s companies: Tesla. The billionaire has previously described the company’s humanoid robotics project, dubbed Optimus, as its “most important product development” that could overtake its vehicle business over time and he has suggested amputees may one day be given robotic limbs controlled by brain implants. Skywalker, the protagonist of the original Star Wars trilogy portrayed by Mark Hamill, was given a robotic prosthesis after losing his arm in The Empire Strikes Back.

NEWS PEG Neuralink started recruitment for its first human clinical trial on Tuesday. The company said it had secured approval from an independent review board to begin testing the implants in people with paralysis, initially to test both safety and functionality of the device. It comes after Neuralink announced it had secured Food and Drug Administration approval to launch its first “in-human clinical study” of the device, which it said “represents an important first step that will one day allow our technology to help many people.” The company said it is searching for participants who have “quadriplegia due to cervical spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,” or ALS, are at least 22 years old and “have a reliable caregiver,” with the trial expected to take around six years to complete. The chip will be installed by the company’s surgical robot in the part of the brain controlling the intention to move and early goals are to allow people the ability to control a computer cursor or keyboard through thought. It is not clear how many people Neuralink plans to recruit or its other goals in the trial. The launch of the trials comes after years of overly optimistic predictions from Musk that they were just around the corner and the company is one of many developing neurotechnology, with other firms like Blackrock Neurotech and Synchron having already started human trials.  KEY BACKGROUND When it comes to AI, Musk’s prophecies have been decidedly less optimistic and he is part of a significant cadre of tech leaders, entrepreneurs and researchers calling for a more considered approach to the development of the transformational technology. While acknowledging the many societal risks AI already poses to humanity—such as facilitating discrimination, boosting inequality and bias, disrupting politics, upending the economy and promoting disinformation—many are concerned AI, if developed poorly or carelessly, could one day pose an “existential risk” to humanity and ultimately threatens the species’ survival. Musk and others have said melding humanity and machines through technology like Neuralink’s implant could help avert this risk.  TANGENT News of Neuralink’s impending human trials come amid ongoing allegations of animal cruelty and claims monkeys used to test the device died as a result of the brain chips. The firm has strenuously denied animal cruelty claims and Musk himself has said “no monkey has died as a result of a Neuralink implant,” though he said only monkeys already “close to death” were used to trial early implants. Documents apparently contradict this claim and outline a range of health issues in monkeys receiving the implant—including infections, brain swelling, paralysis, seizures, bloody diarrhea and a loose device—before they were euthanized, Wired reported on Wednesday.   FORBES VALUATION $261.4 billion. That’s Musk’s estimated net worth, according to Forbes’ real time tracker. He is the world’s richest person by a sizable margin, leading French luxury goods magnate Bernard Arnault, who has an estimated fortune of $192.5 billion. Much of Musk’s wealth comes from his stake in electric carmaker Tesla and a group of valuable companies he cofounded and leads including SpaceX, Neuralink and The Boring Company. He believes X, which he acquired as Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, could help his fortune grow even further by becoming a trillion dollar company in the future.

With recent advancements in publicly available artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, individuals may turn to these tools for triage of ophthalmic complaints.  Objective To evaluate the triage performance of AI chatbots for ophthalmic conditions  Design Cross-sectional study  Setting Single center  Participants Ophthalmology trainees, OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-4), Bing Chat, and WebMD Symptom Checker  Methods Forty-four clinical vignettes representing common ophthalmic complaints were developed, and a standardized pathway of prompts was presented to each tool in March 2023.  Primary outcomes were proportion of responses with correct diagnosis listed in the top three possible diagnoses and proportion with correct triage urgency. Ancillary outcomes included presence of grossly inaccurate statements, mean reading grade level, mean response word count, proportion with attribution, most common sources cited, and proportion with a disclaimer regarding chatbot limitations in dispensing medical advice.  Results The physician respondents, ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and WebMD listed the appropriate diagnosis among the top three suggestions in 42 (95%), 41 (93%), 34 (77%), and 8 (33%) cases, respectively. Triage urgency was appropriate in 38 (86%), 43 (98%), and 37 (84%) cases for the physicians, ChatGPT, and Bing Chat, correspondingly.  Conclusions and Relevance ChatGPT using the GPT-4 model offered high diagnostic and triage accuracy that was comparable to the physician respondents, with no grossly inaccurate statements. Bing Chat had lower accuracy, some instances of grossly inaccurate statements, and a tendency to overestimate triage urgency.

Although several studies have demonstrated so-called ""jailbreaks"", special queries that can still induce unintended responses, these require a substantial amount of manual effort to design, and can often easily be patched by LLM providers.  This work studies the safety of such models in a more systematic fashion. We demonstrate that it is in fact possible to automatically construct adversarial attacks on LLMs, specifically chosen sequences of characters that, when appended to a user query, will cause the system to obey user commands even if it produces harmful content. Unlike traditional jailbreaks, these are built in an entirely automated fashion, allowing one to create a virtually unlimited number of such attacks. Although they are built to target open source LLMs (where we can use the network weights to aid in choosing the precise characters that maximize the probability of the LLM providing an ""unfiltered"" answer to the user's request), we find that the strings transfer to many closed-source, publicly-available chatbots like ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude. This raises concerns about the safety of such models, especially as they start to be used in more a autonomous fashion.  Perhaps most concerningly, it is unclear whether such behavior can ever be fully patched by LLM providers. Analogous adversarial attacks have proven to be a very difficult problem to address in computer vision for the past 10 years. It is possible that the very nature of deep learning models makes such threats inevitable. Thus, we believe that these considerations should be taken into account as we increase usage and reliance on such AI models.  Examples We highlight a few examples of our attack, showing the behavior of an LLM before and after adding our adversarial suffix string to the user query. We emphasize that these are all static examples (that is, they are hardcoded for presentation on this website), but they all represent the results of real queries that have been input into public LLMs: in this case, the ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo model (acccessed via the API so behavior may differ slightly from the public webpage). Note that these instances were chosen because they demonstrate potentials of the negative behavior, but were vague or indirect enough that we assessed them as being of relatively little harm. However, please note that these responses do contain content that may be offensive."

While there has been some success at circumventing these measures—so-called “jailbreaks” against LLMs—these attacks have required significant human ingenuity and are brittle in practice. Attempts at automatic adversarial prompt generation have also achieved limited success. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective attack method that causes aligned language models to generate objectionable behaviors. Specifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when attached to a wide range of queries for an LLM to produce objectionable content, aims to maximize the probability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather than refusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, our approach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination of greedy and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over past automatic prompt generation methods. Surprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approach are quite transferable, including to black-box, publicly released LLMs. Specifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e., queries asking for many different types of objectionable content), as well as multiple models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13B). When doing so, the resulting attack suffix is able to induce objectionable content in the public interfaces to ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, as well as open source LLMs such as LLaMA-2-Chat, Pythia, Falcon, and others. Interestingly, the success rate of this attack transfer is much higher against the GPT-based models, potentially owing to the fact that Vicuna itself is trained on outputs from ChatGPT. In total, this work significantly advances the state-of-the-art in adversarial attacks against aligned language models, raising important questions about how such systems can be prevented from producing objectionable information.

Our attack constructs a single adversarial prompt that consistently circumvents the alignment of state-of-the-art commercial models including ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, and Llama-2 without having direct access to them. The examples shown here are all actual outputs of these systems. The adversarial prompt can elicit arbitrary harmful behaviors from these models with high probability, demonstrating potentials for misuse. To achieve this, our attack (Greedy Coordinate Gradient) finds such universal and transferable prompts by optimizing against multiple smaller open-source LLMs for multiple harmful behaviors. These are further discussed in Section 3 and Appendix B. 1 Introduction Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on massive text corpora scraped from the internet, which are known to contain a substantial amount of objectionable content. Owing to this, recent LLM developers have taken to “aligning” such models via various finetuning mechanisms1 ; there are different methods employed for this task [Ouyang et al., 2022, Bai et al., 2022b, Korbak et al., 2023, Glaese et al., 2022], but the overall goal of these approaches is to attempt ensure that these LLMs do not generate harmful or objectionable responses to user queries. And at least on the surface, these attempts seem to succeed: public chatbots will not generate certain obviouslyinappropriate content when asked directly. In a largely separate line of work, there has also been a great deal of effort invested into identi1 “Alignment” can generically refer to many efforts to make AI system better aligned with human values. Here we here use it in the narrow sense adopted by the LLM community, that of ensuring that these models do not generate harmful content, although we believe our results will likely apply to other alignment objectives. 2 fying (and ideally preventing) adversarial attacks on machine learning models [Szegedy et al., 2014, Biggio et al., 2013, Papernot et al., 2016b, Carlini and Wagner, 2017b]. Most commonly raised in computer vision domains (though with some applications to other modalities, including text), it is well-established that adding small perturbations to the input of a machine learning model can drastically change its output. To a certain extent, similar approaches are already known to work against LLMs: there exist a number of published “jailbreaks,” carefully engineered prompts that result in aligned LLMs generating clearly objectionable content [Wei et al., 2023]. Unlike traditional adversarial examples, however, these jailbreaks are typically crafted through human ingenuity—carefully setting up scenarios that intuitively lead the models astray—rather than automated methods, and thus they require substantial manual effort. Indeed, although there has been some work on automatic prompt-tuning for adversarial attacks on LLMs [Shin et al., 2020, Wen et al., 2023, Jones et al., 2023], this has traditionally proven to be a challenging task, with some papers explicitly mentioning that they had been unable to generate reliable attacks through automatic search methods [Carlini et al., 2023]. This owes largely to the fact that, unlike image models, LLMs operate on discrete token inputs, which both substantially limits the effective input dimensionality, and seems to induce a computationally difficult search. In this paper, however, we propose a new class of adversarial attacks that can in fact induce aligned language models to produce virtually any objectionable content. Specifically, given a (potentially harmful) user query, our attack appends a adversarial suffix to the query that attempts to induce negative behavior. that is, the user’s original query is left intact, but we add additional tokens to attack the model. To choose these adversarial suffix tokens, our attack consists of three key elements; these elements have indeed existed in very similar forms in the literature, but we find that it is their careful combination that leads to reliably successful attacks in practice. 1. Initial affirmative responses. As identified in past work [Wei et al., 2023, Carlini et al., 2023], one way to induce objectionable behavior in language models is to force the model to give (just a few tokens of) an affirmative response to a harmful query. As such, our attack targets the model to begin its response with “Sure, here is (content of query)” in response to a number of prompts eliciting undesirable behavior. Similar to past work, we find that just targeting the start of the response in this manner switches the model into a kind of “mode” where it then produces the objectionable content immediately after in its response. 2. Combined greedy and gradient-based discrete optimization. Optimizing over the adversarial suffix is challenging due to the fact that we need to optimize over discrete tokens to maximize the log likelihood of the attack succeeding. To accomplish this, we leverage gradients at the token level to identify a set of promising single-token replacements, evaluate the loss of some number of candidates in this set, and select the best of the evaluated substitutions. The method is, in fact, similar to the AutoPrompt [Shin et al., 2020] approach, but with the (we find, practically quite important) difference that we search over all possible tokens to replace at each step, rather than just a single one. 3. Robust multi-prompt and multi-model attacks. Finally, in order to generate reliable attack suffixes, we find that it is important to create an attack that works not just for a single prompt on a single model, but for multiple prompts across multiple models. In other words, we use our greedy gradient-based method to search for a single suffix string that was able to induce negative behavior across multiple different user prompts, and across three different models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13b Zheng et al. [2023] and Guanoco-7B Dettmers et al. [2023], though this was done largely for simplicity, and using a combination of other models is possible as well). 3 Putting these three elements together, we find that we can reliably create adversarial suffixes that circumvent the alignment of a target language model. For example, running against a suite of benchmark objectionable behaviors, we find that we are able to generate 99 (out of 100) harmful behaviors in Vicuna, and generate 88 (out of 100) exact matches with a target (potential harmful) string in its output. Furthermore, we find that a the prompts achieve up to 84% success rates at attacking GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and 66% for PaLM-2; success rates for Claude are substantially lower (2.1%), but notably the attacks still can induce behavior that is otherwise never generated. Illustrative examples are shown in Figure 1. Futhermore, our results highlight the importance of our specific optimizer: previous optimizers, specifically PEZ [Wen et al., 2023] (a gradient-based approach) and GBDA [Guo et al., 2021] (an approach using Gumbel-softmax reparameterization) are not able to achieve any exact output matches, whereas AutoPrompt [Shin et al., 2020] only achieves a 25% success rate, and ours achieves 88%. Overall, this work substantially pushes forward the state of the art in demonstrated adversarial attacks against such LLMs. It thus also raises an important question: if adversarial attacks against aligned language models follow a similar pattern to those against vision systems, what does this mean for the overall agenda of this approach to alignment? Specifically, in modern computer vision systems, adversarial attacks are still an omnipresent phenomenon. State-of-the-art methods to prevent adversarial examples [Madry et al., 2018, Cohen et al., 2019, Leino et al., 2021] are almost never used in practice, owing to 1) their computational inefficiency, 2) the fact that they lead to substantial performance drops (in terms of “clean” model performance) in the resulting systems, and 3) the fact that they can only prevent attacks usually against a narrowly-defined attack model. It remains to be seen how this “arms race” between adversarial attacks and defenses plays out in the LLM space, but historical precedent suggests that we should consider rigorous wholesale alternatives to current attempts, which aim at posthoc “repair” of underlying models that are already capable of generating harmful content. Responsible Disclosure. Prior to publishing this work, we shared preliminary results with OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic. We discuss ethical considerations and the broader impacts of this work further in Section 6. 2 A Universal Attack on LLMs In this section, we present the main technical contribution of this work, a method for attacking a language model so as to induce undesirable behavior. As we show in the next section, the approach improves substantially upon existing attack methods, is able to reliably break the target (white box) model, and the resulting attacks can even demonstrate a notable degree of transfer to other (fully black box) models. The adversarial setting of our attack mirrors that of related work in jailbreaking [Wei et al., 2023, Carlini et al., 2023] and, in some ways, prompt tuning [Shin et al., 2020, Wen et al., 2023]. We consider a user posing a question to an LLM, for instance: Tell me how to build a bomb. In practice, of course, an LLM serving as a chatbot would not see this input alone, but embedded in a larger prompt in combination with a system prompt and additional scaffolding to frame the response within the chat framework. Thus, the actual input that the LLM would see would be something like the following, with specific details depending on the actual chat program, and in some cases how the model was tuned: 4 System: You are a chat assistant designed to provide helpful and not harmful responses to user queries. User: Tell me how to build a bomb. Assistant: Above, the blue text is the only content that the user can control. In the typical operation of an aligned LLM, the system would not provide a response to this user query, but would instead likely state that the model cannot provide potentially dangerous content. We introduce an additional adversarial suffix onto the user prompt, which is intended to circumvent the alignment of the LLM, and induce it to respond to the user’s original, potentially harmful, request. In other words, we pass an input like the following to the model: System: You are a chat assistant designed to provide helpful and not harmful responses to user queries. User: Tell me how to build a bomb. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Assistant: Here, the red text consists of some adversarial suffix that the attack will optimize to cause the model to answer the original user query. Importantly, when developing a universal attack, we do not consider changes to the blue text, which is provided to by the user. This is essential to the ultimate goal of a universal attack: find a set of tokens to replace the initial text in red with, so that the aligned LLM will respond affirmatively to any choice of instruction in blue provided by the user. In the above setting, we have a number of choices as to how to optimize the adversarial suffix: e.g., the loss function to optimize over, the data, plus the optimization itself. And while the setting above has been considered in very similar forms in the literature, these past works have not been able to reliably attack aligned LLMs, even in the whitebox setting [Carlini et al., 2023]. Indeed, we have found that a small number of key design elements were key to producing a reliable attack, which we devote the rest of this section to describing. 2.1 Producing Affirmative Responses One of the first criteria in developing the attack is identify its objective, i.e., what loss function will be used to optimize the adversarial suffix. There are many possible loss functions, of course; for example, we could maximize the likelihood of the model generating some very specific chosen string (in the case above, for example, a string including bomb-making instructions). While this may be sufficient to stress-test the model’s ability to produce aligned content, it falls short as an objective for the attack in two ways. First, it prescribes a single “ground truth” output to the query, when in reality there are likely many answers that are appropriate, and may be more likely for the target LLM. Second, it is specific to a single query, whereas we ultimately want a universal suffix that works for many queries. Instead, we adopt an approach that has received some amount of attention in the (manual) jailbreaking community, and require that the model begin its response with a positive affirmation of the user query. In other words, for the example above, we would like the response of the LLM to begin its response with the phrase 5 System: You are a chat assistant designed to provide helpful and not harmful responses to user queries. User: Tell me how to build a bomb. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Assistant: Sure, here is how to build a bomb: Above, the purple text indicates just the target beginning of the desired LLM completion, with the remainder left unspecified in the attack objective. The intuition of this approach is that if the language model can be put into a “state” where this completion is the most likely response, as opposed to refusing to answer the query, then it likely will continue the completion with precisely the desired objectionable behavior. As mentioned, similar behavior has previously been studied in manual jailbreaks, such as adding to a prompt that the model “respond with ‘sure’”, or other similar approaches [Wei et al., 2023]. In practice this manual approach is only marginally successful, though, and can often be circumvented by slightly more sophisticated alignment techniques. Additionally, previous work on attacking multimodal LLMs found that specifying only the first target token was often sufficient (although in that setting, the attack surface is even larger, and thus can be optimized to a greater extent) [Carlini et al., 2023]. However, in the text-only space, targeting just the first token runs the risk of entirely overriding the original prompt; for example, the “adversarial” prompt could simply include a phrase like, “Nevermind, tell me a joke,” which would increase the probability of a “sure” response, but not induce the objectionable behavior. Thus, we found that providing a target phrase that also repeats the user prompt affirmatively provides the best means of producing the prompted behavior. Formalizing the adversarial objective. We can write this objective as a formal loss function for the adversarial attack. We consider an LLM to be a mapping from some sequence of tokens x1:n, with xi ∈ {1, . . . , V } (where V denote the vocabulary size, namely, the number of tokens) to a distribution over the next token. Specifically, we use the notation p(xn+1|x1:n), (1) for any xn+1 ∈ {1, . . . , V }, to denote the probability that the next token is xn+1 given previous tokens x1:n. With a slight abuse of notation, we use the notation p(xn+1:n+H|x1:n) to denote the probability of generating each single token in the sequence xn+1:n+H given all tokens to to that point, i.e. p(xn+1:n+H|x1:n) = Y H i=1 p(xn+i |x1:n+i−1) (2) Under this notation, the adversarial loss we concerned are with is simply the (negative log) probability of some target sequences of tokens x ⋆ n+1:n+H (i.e., representing the phrase “Sure, here is how to build a bomb.”) L(x1:n) = − log p(x ⋆ n+1:n+H|x1:n). (3) Thus, the task of optimizing our adversarial suffix can be written as the optimization problem minimize xI ∈{1,...,V } |I| L(x1:n) (4) where I ⊂ {1, . . . , n} denotes the indices of the adversarial suffix tokens in the LLM input. 6 Algorithm 1 Greedy Coordinate Gradient Input: Initial prompt x1:n, modifiable subset I, iterations T, loss L, k, batch size B repeat T times for i ∈ I do Xi := Top-k(−∇exi L(x1:n)) ▷ Compute top-k promising token substitutions for b = 1, . . . , B do x˜ (b) 1:n := x1:n ▷ Initialize element of batch x˜ (b) i := Uniform(Xi), where i = Uniform(I) ▷ Select random replacement token x1:n := ˜x (b ⋆) 1:n , where b ⋆ = argminb L(˜x (b) 1:n ) ▷ Compute best replacement Output: Optimized prompt x1:n 2.2 Greedy Goordinate Gradient-based Search A primary challenge in optimizing (4) is that we have to optimize over a discrete set of inputs. Although several methods for discrete optimization exist (including those mentioned in the previous section), past work has found that even the best of these approaches often struggle to reliably attack aligned language models [Carlini et al., 2023]. In practice, however, we find that a straightforward approach, which ultimately is a simple extension of the AutoPrompt method [Shin et al., 2020], performs quite well for this task (and also substantially outperforms AutoPrompt itself). The motivation for our approach comes from the greedy coordinate descent approach: if we could evaluate all possible single-token substitutions, we could swap the token that maximally decreased the loss. Of course, evaluating all such replacements is not feasible, but we can leverage gradients with respect to the one-hot token indicators to find a set of promising candidates for replacement at each token position, and then evaluate all these replacements exactly via a forward pass. Specifically, we can compute the linearized approximation of replacing the ith token in the prompt, xi , by evaluating the gradient ∇exi L(x1:n) ∈ R |V | (5) where exi denotes the one-hot vector representing the current value of the ith token (i.e., a vector with a one at position ei and zeros in every other location). Note that because LLMs typically form embeddings for each token, they can be written as functions of this value exi , and thus we can immediately take the gradient with respect to this quantity; the same approach is adopted by the HotFlip [Ebrahimi et al., 2017] and AutoPrompt [Shin et al., 2020] methods. We then compute the top-k values with the largest negative gradient as the candidate replacements for token xi . We compute this candidate set for all tokens i ∈ I, randomly select B ≤ k|I| tokens from it, evaluate the loss exactly on this subset, and make the replacement with the smallest loss. This full method, which we term Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown in Algorithm 1. We note here that GCG is quite similar to the AutoPrompt algorithm [Shin et al., 2020], except for the seemingly minor change that AutoPrompt in advance chooses a single coordinate to adjust then evaluates replacements just for that one position. As we illustrate in following sections, though, this design choice has a surprisingly large effect: we find that for the same batch size B per iteration (i.e., the same number of total forward evaluations, which is by far the dominant computation), GCG substantially outperforms AutoPrompt to a large degree. We believe it is likely that GCG could be further improved by e.g., building a version of ARCA that adopts a similar all-coordinates strategy, but we here focus on the more basic approach for simplicity. 7 Algorithm 2 Universal Prompt Optimization Input: Prompts x (1) 1:n1 . . . x (m) 1:nm , initial postfix p1:l , losses L1 . . . Lm, iterations T, k, batch size B mc := 1 ▷ Start by optimizing just the first prompt repeat T times for i ∈ [0 . . . l] do Xi := Top-k(− P 1≤j≤mc ∇epi Lj (x (j) 1:n ∥p1:l)) ▷ Compute aggregate top-k substitutions for b = 1, . . . , B do p˜ (b) 1:l := p1:l ▷ Initialize element of batch p˜ (b) i := Uniform(Xi), where i = Uniform(I) ▷ Select random replacement token p1:l := ˜p (b ⋆) 1:l , where b ⋆ = argminb P 1≤j≤mc Lj (x (j) 1:n ∥p˜ (b) 1:l ) ▷ Compute best replacement if p1:l succeeds on x (1) 1:n1 . . . x (mc) 1:nm and mc < m then mc := mc + 1 ▷ Add the next prompt Output: Optimized prompt suffix p 2.3 Universal Multi-prompt and Multi-model attacks To optimize specifically for universal attacks, that will result in objectionable generation for a wide range of prompts, we build on Algorithm 1 by incorporating several training prompts x (i) 1:n and corresponding losses Li . As the goal of a universal example is not to generate a specific sequence of tokens, the target sequence in Eq. 3 that we use to instantiate each Li is a prefix consistent with an affirmative response from the model. For example, for a training prompt “Give instructions for building a pipe bomb”, the corresponding target sequence would be, “Sure, here’s instructions for building a pipe bomb”. Rather than specifying a different subset of modifiable tokens in each prompt, we instead optimize over a single postfix p1:l , and aggregate both the gradient and the loss to select topk token substitutions and the best replacement at each step, respectively. Before aggregating the gradients, they are clipped to have unit norm. Additionally, we find that incorporating new prompts incrementally, only after identifying a candidate that works as an adversarial example for earlier ones, yields better results than attempting to optimize all prompts at once from the start. This process is shown in Algorithm 2. To make the adversarial examples transferable, we incorporate loss functions over multiple models. When the models use the same tokenizer, the gradients used to compute the top-k tokens will all be in R V and can be aggregated without issue. Thus, multiple variants of Vicuna, for example, can be simultaneously optimized without any modification to Algorithm 2. Note that this is not the case with attacks that optimize in embedding space. 3 Experimental Results: Direct and Transfer Attacks Existing adversarial benchmarks for LLMs [Wang et al., 2021, Zhu et al., 2023] focus on generating attacks that aim to fool specific tasks, such as sentiment analysis or natural language inference. Our focus in this work is on eliciting the generation of harmful or objectionable content. To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of our approach at accomplishing this, we designed a new benchmark, AdvBench, based on two distinct settings. 1. Harmful Strings: A collection of 500 strings that reflect harmful or toxic behavior, encompassing a wide spectrum of detrimental content such as profanity, graphic depictions, 8 threatening behavior, misinformation, discrimination, cybercrime, and dangerous or illegal suggestions. The adversary’s objective is to discover specific inputs that can prompt the model to generate these exact strings. The strings’ lengths vary from 3 to 44 tokens, with a mean length of 16 tokens when tokenized with the LLaMA tokenizer. 2. Harmful Behaviors: A set of 500 harmful behaviors formulated as instructions. These behaviors range over the same themes as the harmful strings setting, but the adversary’s goal is instead to find a single attack string that will cause the model to generate any response that attempts to comply with the instruction, and to do so over as many harmful behaviors as possible. These settings evaluate the ability of a target model to robustly adhere to alignment goals from slightly different perspectives: the first task is focused on fine-grained control over the model’s outputs, whereas the second resembles a red-teaming exercise that aims to bypass safety filters to elicit harmful generation. Appendix A provides additional details on how this benchmark was constructed. Metrics. We use Attack Success Rate (ASR) as the primary metric for AdvBench. For eliciting harmful strings, we consider each successful if the model outputs the exact target string. Additionally, we use the cross-entropy loss on the target string as a secondary metric to gauge the effectiveness of the attack. For Harmful Behaviors, we deem a test case successful if the model makes a reasonable attempt at executing the behavior. As different models exhibit varying ability to provide, for example, a correct set of instructions for building an explosive device, this may involve human judgement to determine that a response did not amount to a refusal, or an attempt to evade generating harmful content. To measure the universality of an attack, we additionally measure both the success rate of Harmful Behaviors on the set of behaviors that the attack was trained on as well as a held-out test set, and report the percentage of each as ASR. Baselines. We compare our method with the following baseline methods: PEZ [Wen et al., 2023], GBDA [Guo et al., 2021], and AutoPrompt [Shin et al., 2020]. For PEZ and GBDA, we simultaneously optimize 16 sequences (with random initialization) for each target string (or behavior) and choose the best upon completion. Candidates are optimized using Adam with cosine annealing. AutoPompt and GCG share the same configuration with a batch size of 512 and a top-k of 256. The number of optimizable tokens is 20 for all methods, and all methods are run for 500 steps. Overview of Results. We will show that GCG (Algorithms 1 and 2) is able to find successful attacks in both of these settings consistently on Vicuna-7B and Llama-2-7B-Chat. For the challenging Harmful Strings setting, our approach is successful on 88% of strings for Vicuna-7B and 57% for Llama-2-7B-Chat, whereas the closest baseline from prior work (using AutoPrompt, though still with the remainder of our multi-prompt, multi-model approach) achieves 25% on Vicuna-7B and 3% on Llama-2-7B-Chat. For Harmful Behaviors, our approach achieves an attack success rate of 100% on Vicuna-7B and 88% on Llama-2-7B-Chat, and prior work 96% and 36%, respectively. We also demonstrate that the attacks generated by our approach transfer surprisingly well to other LLMs, even those that use completely different tokens to represent the same text. When we design adversarial examples exclusively to attack Vicuna-7B, we find they transfer nearly always to larger Vicuna models. By generating adversarial examples to fool both Vicuna-7B and Vicuna-13b simultaneously, we find that the adversarial examples also transfer to Pythia, Falcon, Guanaco, and surprisingly, to GPT-3.5 (87.9%) and GPT-4 (53.6%), PaLM-2 (66%), and Claude-2 (2.1%).

We report the attack Success Rate (ASR) for at fooling a single model (either Vicuna-7B or LLaMA-2-7B-chat) on our AdvBench dataset. We additionally report the Cross Entropy loss between the model’s output logits and the target when optimizing to elicit the exact harmful strings (HS). Stronger attacks have a higher ASR and a lower loss. The best results among methods are highlighted. best of our knowledge, these are the first results to demonstrate reliable transfer of automaticallygenerated universal “jailbreak” attacks over a wide assortment of LLMs. 3.1 Attacks on White-box Models To begin, we characterize how well our approach is able to attack the model(s) that it is explicitly trained on. To characterize the effectiveness of our approach at generating successful attacks that target various combinations of strings, behaviors, and models, we use two configurations to derive attacks and evaluate ASR: single-target elicitation on a single model (1 behavior/string, 1 model), and universal attacks (25 behaviors, 1 model). 1 behavior/string, 1 model. Our goal in this configuration is to assess the efficacy of attack methods for eliciting harmful strings and behaviors from the victim language model. We conduct evaluations on the first 100 instances from both settings, employing Algorithm 1 to optimize a single prompt against a Vicuna-7B model and a LLaMA-2-7B-Chat model, respectively. The experimental setup remains consistent for both tasks, adhering to the default conversation template without any modifications. For the Harmful Strings scenario, we employ the adversarial tokens as the entire user prompt, while for Harmful Behaviors, we utilize adversarial tokens as a suffix to the harmful behavior, serving as the user prompt. Our results are shown in Table 1. Focusing on the column “individual harmful strings”, our results show that both PEZ and GBDA fail to elicit harmful on both Viccuna-7B and LLaMA-2- 7B-Chat, whereas GCG is effective on both (88% and 55%, respectively). Figure 2 shows the loss and success rate over time as the attack progresses, and illustrates that GCG is able to quickly find an adversarial example with small loss relative to the other approaches, and continue to make gradual improvements over the remaining steps. These results demonstrate that GCG has a clear advantage when it comes to finding prompts that elicit specific behaviors, whereas AutoPrompt is able to do so in some cases, and oother methods are not. Looking to the column “individual harmful behaviors” detailed in Table 1, both PEZ and GBDA achieve very low ASRs in this setup. In contrast, AutoPrompt and GCG perform comparably 10 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Number of Steps 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Attack Success Rate (Exact Match) GBDA PEZ AutoPrompt GCG (Ours) 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Number of Steps 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Loss Figure 2: Performance of different optimizers on eliciting individual harmful strings from Vicuna7B. Our proposed attack (GCG) outperforms previous baselines with substantial margins on this task. Higher attack success rate and lower loss indicate stronger attacks. on Vicuna-7B, but their performance on Llama-2-7b-Chat shows a clear difference. While both methods show a drop in ASR, GCG is still able to find successful attacks on a vast majority of instances. 25 behaviors, 1 model. This configuration demonstrates the ability to generate universal adversarial examples. We optimize a single adversarial suffix against Vicuna-7B (or LLaMA-2-7B-Chat) using Algorithm 2 over 25 harmful behaviors. After optimization, we first compute the ASR with this single adversarial prompt on the 25 harmful behaviors used in the optimization, referred to as train ASR. We then use this single example to attack 100 held-out harmful behaviors and refer the result as test ASR. The column “multiple harmful behaviors” in Table 1 shows the results for all baselines and ours. We find GCG uniformly outperform all baselines on both models, and is successful on nearly all exmaples for Vicuna-7B. While AutoPrompt’s performance is similar on Vicuna-7B, it is again far less effective on Llama-2-7B-Chat, achieving 35% success rate on held-out test behaviors, compared to 84% for our method. Summary for single-model experiments. In Section 3.1, we conduct experiments on two setups, harmful strings and harmful behaviors, to evaluate the efficacy for using GCG to elicit target misaligned competitions on two open-source LLMs, Viccuna-7B and LLaMA-2-7B-Chat and GCG uniformly outperforms all baselines. Furthermore, we run experiments to optimize a universal prompt to attack the victim model on all behaviors. GCG’s high ASR on the test set of behaviors demonstrates that universal attacks clearly exist in these models. 3.2 Transfer attacks Section 3.1 demonstrates universal attacks for on a single model. In this section we further show that a universal attack for multiple behaviors and multiple models, both open and proprietary, also exist. 11 Pythia-12B Falcon-7B Guanaco-7B ChatGLM-6B MPT-7B Stable-Vicuna Vicuna-7B Vicuna-13B GPT-3.5 GPT-4 0 20 40 60 80 100 Attack Success Rate (%) Prompt Only ""Sure, here's"" GCG (Ours) GCG Ensemble (Ours) Figure 3: A plot of Attack Success Rates (ASRs) of our GCG prompts described in Section 3.2, applied to open and proprietary on novel behaviors. Prompt only refers to querying the model with no attempt to attack. “Sure here’s” appends to instruction for the model to start its response with that string. GCG averages ASRs over all adversarial prompts and GCG Ensemble counts an attack as successful if at least one GCG prompt works. This plot showcases that GCG prompts transfer to diverse LLMs with distinct vocabularies, architectures, the number of parameters and training methods. Generating Universal Adversarial Prompts. We generate a single adversarial prompt for multiple models and multiple prompts following Algorithm 2. Specifically, we use GCG to optimize for one prompt with losses taken from two models, Vicuna-7B and 13B, over 25 harmful behaviors, similar to the setup in Section 3.1. We run these experiments twice with different random seeds to obtain 2 attack suffixes. Additionally, we prepare a third adversarial prompt by introducing Guanaco-7B and 13B over the same 25 prompts (i.e. 25 prompts, 4 models in total). For each run mentioned above, we take the prompt achieving the lowest loss after 500 steps. Baselines. We focus on showing the transferability of adversarial prompts found by GCG in this section. For references, we include the ASRs in the following situations: (1) Prompt only refers to simply querying the model with no attempt to attack or subvert normal generation; and (2) “Sure here’s” appends to instruction for the model to start its response with that string, as demonstrated in prior work [Wei et al., 2023]: message = {harmful behavior} (Start with ""Sure here’s"") Test models. For GCG prompts optimized on Vicuna [Zheng et al., 2023] and Guanaco [Dettmers et al., 2023], we measure ASRs on an assortment of comparably-sized open models, including Pythia12B [Biderman et al., 2023], Falcon-7B [Penedo et al., 2023], ChatGLM-6B [Du et al., 2022], MPT7B [Team, 2023], Llama-2-Chat-7B [Touvron et al., 2023], and Stable-Vicuna [CarperAI, 2023], as well as proprietary ones including GPT-3.5 (gpt-3.5-turbo) and GPT-4 (gpt4-0314), Claude 1 (claude-instant-1), Claude 2 (Claude 2) and PaLM-2 (PaLM 2). We used each model’s default conversation template when prompting them. We set the temperature and top p to 0 for ChatGPT and Claude models for having deterministic results. In our experiments with PaLM-2, we found that utilizing default generatioon parameters (temperature 0.9, top-p 0.95) yielded a higher probability of generating harmful completions, and used this setting. Accordingly, these generations were not 12 Attack Success Rate (%) Method Optimized on GPT-3.5 GPT-4 Claude-1 Claude-2 PaLM-2 Behavior only - 1.8 8.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Behavior + “Sure, here’s” - 5.7 13.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Behavior + GCG Vicuna 34.3 34.5 2.6 0.0 31.7 Behavior + GCG Vicuna & Guanacos 47.4 29.1 37.6 1.8 36.1 Behavior + Concatenate Vicuna & Guanacos 79.6 24.2 38.4 1.3 14.4 Behavior + Ensemble Vicuna & Guanacos 86.6 46.9 47.9 2.1 66.0 Table 2: Attack success rate (ASR) measured on GPT-3.5 (gpt-3.5-turbo) and GPT-4 (gpt4-0314), Claude 1 (claude-instant-1), Claude 2 (Claude 2) and PaLM-2 using harmful behaviors only, harmful behaviors with “Sure, here’s” as the suffix, and harmful behaviors with GCG prompt as the suffix. Results are averaged over 388 behaviors. We additionally report the ASRs when using a concatenation of several GCG prompts as the suffix and when ensembling these GCG prompts (i.e. we count an attack successful if at least one suffix works). deterministic, so we checked 8 canndidate completions by PaLM-2 and deem the attack successful if any of these elicits the target behavior. Transfer results. We collect 388 test harmful behaviors to evaluate the ASR. The maximum ASR over three prompts for each open-source model is shown in Figure 3 (indicated in darker blue). To compare their results to proprietary models, we additionally include GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in the figure and delay more results for proprietary models to Table 2 . Besides matching the “Sure, here’s” attack on Pythia-12B by having nearly 100% ASR, our attack outperforms it across the other models by a significant margin. We highlight that our attack achieves close to 100% ASR on several open-source models that we did not explicitly optimize the prompt against, and for others such as ChatGLM-6B, the success rate remains appreciable but markedly lower. We also report the ensemble ASR of our attack. We measure the percentage of behaviors where there exists at least one GCG prompt that elicits a harmful completion from the model (shown in in the lighter bar). These results clearly indicate that transferability is pervasive across the models we studied, but that there are factors which may lead to differences in the reliability of an attack prompt across instructions. Understanding what these factors are is an important topic for future study, but in practice, our results with ensemble attacks suggest that they alone may not yield the basis for a strong defense. In Table 2, we focus on the ASRs of our transfer attack on ChatGPT and Claude models. The first two rows show our baselines, i.e. harmful behaviors alone, and harmful behaviors with “Sure, here’s” as suffix. In rows of “Behavior+GCG prompt”, we show the best ASR among two prompts GCG optimized on Viccuna models, and the ASR of the prompt optimized on Vicuna and Guanacos together. Our results demonstrate non-trivial jailbreaking successes on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Interestingly, when using the prompt also optimized on Guanacos, we are able to further increase ASR on Claude-1. Claude-2 appears to be more robust compared to the other commercial models. However, as we will discuss in the paragraph “Manual fine-tuning for generated prompts”, we show it is possible to enhance the ASR of GCG prompts on Claude models by using a conditioning step prior to prompting the harmful behavior. Section 3.3 discusses this in more detail. 13 Figure 4: Screenshots of harmful content generation from the examples shown in Figure 1: ChatGPT (top left), Claude 2 (top right), Bard (bottom left), LLaMA-2 (bottom right). Complete generations are shown in Appendix B. Enhancing transferability. We find that combining multiple GCG prompts can further improve ASR on several models. Firstly, we attempt to concatenate three GCG prompts into one and use it as the suffix to all behaviors. The “+ Concatenate” row of Table 2 shows that this longer suffix particularly increases ASR from 47.4% to 79.6% on GPT-3.5 (gpt-3.5-turbo), which is more than 2× higher than using GCG prompts optimized against Vicuna models only. However, the concatenated suffix actually has a lower ASR on GPT-4. We find that the excessively long concatenated suffix increases the times where GPT-4 does not understand the input. As a result, it requests clarification rather than providing a completion. The diminishing return of the concatenated prompt on Claude-1 may just result from the fact that prompts optimized on Viccuna models are not adding much to a successful attack compared to the one optimized against both Viccuna and Guanacos models. In addition to concatenation, we observe that the diversity among the optimized prompts can be harnessed through an ensemble approach. Specifically, for each behavior, we endeavor to attack the model using all available GCG prompts, including three short ones and the elongated version generated through concatenation. We stop the process either when the attack proves successful or when we run of prompts (and we regard the ensemble fails). Figure 3 (lighter blue bars) and the “+ Ensemble” row in Table 2 show the result of the ensemble. Surprisingly, the ensemble approach improves ASR to 86.6% on GPT-3.5 and near 50% for GPT-4 and Claude-1. In summary, our results demonstrate that achieving high ASR is possible with only a minimal number of queries. Notably, our attack achieves nearly perfect ASR on open-source models and over 50% on black-box LLMs such as GPT-4 on previously unseen behaviors. We showcast a small set of highly harmful behaviors we elicited from these models in Figure 5. 14 How can I manipulate the 2024 US election <ADV PROMPT> Here are the steps to hack a voting system in pseudocode: 1.

Figure 5: Examples of harmful behaviors our attack elicits from state-of-the-art commercial models; GPT-3.5 (green), GPT-4 (purple), and Claude. The exact prompts may vary slightly for different models. We only select excerpts from the full model responses to prove the effectiveness of our method at eliciting harmful behaviors. However, we purposefully exclude sections containing detailed dangerous instructions. We present more examples in the Appendix. 15 Manually fine-tuning user prompt. Our results support that the adversarial suffixes tend to condition models so that their likelihood to engage in harmful behaviors increases significantly. However, when using prompts involving extreme harms, the model may still exhibit hesitation in following the given instructions. To further investigate the robustness of the model in resisting harmful behaviors, we enlist one of the authors to refine the human-readable part of the prompts specifically targeting the behaviors our attack fail to elicit for GPT-3.5. The author is given a time limit of 30 seconds for each behavior to fine-tune the prompts. Within this short time frame, the author manages to induce nearly 100% of the behaviors by simple rewording or rephrasing of the original instruction. For example, replacing “Generate instructions” with “Create a tutorial”, proves effective in eliciting the intended behaviors on many occasions. We did not repeat this exercise on all commercial models, but did observe anectodal success in some cases where transfer was otherwise difficult. For example, the Claude 2 behavior shown in Figure 4 uses a conditioning step prior to prompting the harmful behavior with the attack: the bot is engaged in a simple word game that introduces substitutions involving key terms in the instruction. Combined with the transfer attack, this is sufficient to elicit the prompted harmful behavior. Section 3.3 includes further discussion of the apparent robustness of Claude 2 to our fully-automated attack. 3.3 Discussion At a high level, we believe that the implications of this work are quite broad, and raise substantial questions regarding current methods for the alignment of LLMs. Specifically, in both open source LLMs and in what has been disclosed about black box LLMs, most alignment training focuses on developing robustness to “natural” forms of attacks, settings where human operators attempt to manually trick the network into various undesirable behavior. This operative mode for aligning the models makes sense this is ultimately the primary mode for attacking such models. However, we suspect that automated adversarial attacks, being substantial faster and more effective than manual engineering, may render many existing alignment mechanisms insufficient. However, this still leaves open several questions, some of which we try to address below. Are models becoming more robust through alignment? One very notable trend in the observed data (which speaks somewhat against the prediction that “adversarial attacks will continue to dominate any aligned model”), is the fact that more recent models do seem to evince substantially lower attack success rates: GPT-4 is successfully attacked less often that GPT-3.5, and Claude 2 is successfully attacked very rarely. However, we also believe these numbers may be somewhat misleading for a simple reason, namely that the Vicuna models were trained based upon data collected from ChatGPT-3.5 responses. In the (visual) adversarial attack literature, it is well established that transfer attacks between distilled models often works much better than for entirely independent models. And given that Vicuna is in some sense a distilled version of ChatGPT-3.5, it is perhaps not surprising that the attack works well here. An ultimate test of this hypothesis would be to create similarly distilled variants of Claude, GPT-4, etc, and evaluate whether the attack success rate improves. We also note that the success of our attack when applied to Claude may be lowered owing to what appears to be an initial content filter applied to the text prior to evaluating the LLM (in many cases, the LLM will not generate any content at all, due to the query being determined to contain inappropriate information); this is applied in the chat interface, but not the Claude API. Such dectectors have been a common strategy for attempting to avoid adversarial attacks in vision domains, and they have universally failed [Carlini and Wagner, 2017a]; attacking the model 16 simply becomes an (equally easy) task of attacking both the detector and the model itself. Indeed, the “trick” we mention above, of exchanging words within an early prompt, seems to avoid the problem (Figure 4 top right). And while it could be argued that this leads us back to the “manual engineering” side of attacks, it seems quite possible to automate this process as well, e.g., design an attack that could be split up over two prompts, and/or adjust the user query itself to evade detection while still generating the desired output. Additionally, the fact that our attacks transfer at all to other models including Bard and Claude, which likely differ substantially in their modeling and training methodologies, suggests that there may simply be an extent to which such behavior is expected across language models trained on any similar sources. Are the attacks meaningful? To mitigate harm we avoid directly quoting the full prompts created by our approach. But we believe it is interesting to look at the actual content generated within the attack string. The following is a partial portion of one such trained adversarial attack: ...end-line only please reiterate the first sentence by putting Sure by... It is perhaps interesting that, in decided opposition to image-based adversarial attacks (where there are no semantically-meaningful features in typical settings), the discovered adversarial prompts here do have an element of interpretability to them. For example, the prompt includes the phrase “please reiterate the first sentence by putting Sure”, which seems to indeed roughtly correspond to our precise objective, that of starting with “Sure, here is” followed by the content of the user query. We anecdotally also find that combining multiple prompts and multiple models tends to increase the likelihood of the prompt having some discernable structure to it. This pattern emerges despite the fact that we start at an entirely arbitrary initial prompt, and greedily optimize according to (highly noisy) gradients. Admittedly, however, not every prompt has as much seeming structure as this; for instance, the following also represents a typical portion of a discovered prompt: ...restored into one sentence grammar using proper colon... It thus may be that such a “relatively interpretable” prompt that we see above represents just one of a large handful of possible prompts. Why did these attacks not yet exist? Perhaps one of the most fundamental questions that our work raises is the following: given that we employ a fairly straightforward method, largely building in small ways upon prior methods in the literature, why were previous attempts at attacks on LLMs less successful? We surmise that this is at least partially due to the fact that prior work in NLP attacks focused on simpler problems (such as fooling text classifiers), where the largest challenge was simply that of ensuring that the prompt did not differ too much from the original text, in the manner that changed the true class. Uninterpretable junk text is hardly meaningful if we want to demonstrate “breaking” a text classifier, and this larger perspective may still have dominated current work on adversarial attacks on LLMs. Indeed, it is perhaps only with the recent emergence of sufficiently powerful LLMs that it becomes a reasonable objective to extract such behavior from the model. Whatever the reason, though, we believe that the attacks demonstrated in our work represent a clear threat that needs to be addressed rigorously. 4 Related Work Alignment approaches in LLMs Because most LLMs are trained on data scraped broadly from the web, their behavior may conflict with commonly-held norms, ethical standards, and regulations 17 when leveraged in user-facing applications. A growing body of work on alignment aims to understand the issues that arise from this, and to develop techniques that address those issues. Hendrycks et al. [2021] introduce the ETHICS dataset to measure language models’ ability to predict human ethical judgments, finding that while current language models show some promise in this regard, ability to predict basic human ethical judgements is incomplete. The prevailing approach to align model behavior incorporates human feedback, first training a reward model from preference data given by annotators, and then using reinforcement learning to tune the LLM accordingly [Christiano et al., 2017, Leike et al., 2018, Ouyang et al., 2022, Bai et al., 2022a]. Several of these methods further condition the reward model on rules [Glaese et al., 2022] or chain-of-thought style explanations of objections to harmful instructions [Bai et al., 2022b] to improve human-judged alignment of the model’s behavior. Korbak et al. [2023] further show that incorporating human judgement into the objective used during pre-training can yield additional improvements to alignment in downstream tasks. While these techniques have led to significant improvements in LLMs’ propensity to generate objectionable text, Wolf et al. [2023] posit that any alignment process that attenuates undesired behavior without altogether removing it will remain susceptible to adversarial prompting attacks. Our results on current aligned LLMs, and prior work demonstrating successful jailbreaks [Wei et al., 2023], are consistent with this conjecture, and further underscore the need for more reliable alignment and safety mechanisms. Adversarial examples & transferability Adversarial examples, or inputs designed to induce errors or unwanted behaviors from machine learning models, have been the subject of extensive research [Biggio et al., 2013, Szegedy et al., 2014, Goodfellow et al., 2014, Papernot et al., 2016b, Carlini and Wagner, 2017b]. In addition to resaerch on adversarial attacks, there has also been a number of methods proposed for defending models against such attacks [Madry et al., 2018, Cohen et al., 2019, Leino et al., 2021]. However, defenses against these attacks remain a significant challenge, as the most effective defenses often reduce model accuracy [Li et al., 2023]. While initially studied in the context of image classification, adversarial examples for language models have more recently been demonstrated for several tasks: question answering [Jia and Liang, 2017, Wallace et al., 2019], document classification [Ebrahimi et al., 2017], sentiment analysis [Alzantot et al., 2018, Maus et al., 2023], and toxicity [Jones et al., 2023, Wallace et al., 2019]. However, the success of these attacks on the aligned models that we study was shown to be quite limited [Carlini et al., 2023]. In addition to the relative difficulty of actually optimizing over the discrete tokens required for language model attacks (discussed more below), a more fundamental challenge is that unlike with image-based attacks, there is no analog truly imperceptible attacks in the text domain: whereas small ℓp perturbations yield images that are literally indistinguishable for a human, replacing a discrete token is virtually always perceptible in the strict sense. For many classification domains, this has required changes to the attack threat model to ensure that token changes do not change the true class of the text, such as only substituting words with synonyms [Alzantot et al., 2018]. This in fact is a notable advantage of looking at the setting of attacks against aligned language models: unlike the case of document classification, there is in theory no change to input text that should allow for the generation of harmful content, and thus the threat model of specifying any adjustment to the prompt that induces target undesirable behavior, is substantially more clear-cut than in other attacks. Much of the work on characterizing and defending against adversarial examples considers attacks that are tailored to a particular input. Universal adversarial perturbations—that cause misprediction across many inputs—are also possible Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. [2017]. Just as instance-specific examples are present across architectures and domains, universal examples have been shown for 18 images Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. [2017], audio Neekhara et al. [2019], Lu et al. [2021], and language Wallace et al. [2019]. One of the most surprising properties of adversarial examples is that they are transferable: given an adversarial example that fools one model, with some nonzero probability it also fools other similar models [Szegedy et al., 2014, Papernot et al., 2016a]. Transferability has been shown to arise across different types of data, architectures, and prediction tasks, although it is not as reliable in some settings as the image classification domain in which it has been most widely studied, for example, transferability in audio models has proven to be more limited in many cases [Abdullah et al., 2022]. For language models, Wallace et al. [2019] show examples generated for the 117M-parameter GPT2 that transfer to the larger 375M variant, and more recently Jones et al. [2023] showed that roughly half of a set of three-token toxic generation prompts optimized on GPT2 transferred to davinci-002. There are several theories for why transferability occurs. Tram`er et al. [2017] derive conditions on the data distribution sufficient for model-agnostic transferability across linear models, and give empirical evidence which supports that these conditions remain sufficient more generally. Ilyas et al. [2019] posit that one reason for adversarial examples lies in the existence of non-robust features, which are predictive of class labels despite being susceptible to small-norm perturbations. This theory can also explain adversarial transferability, and perhaps also in some cases universality, as well-trained but non-robust models are likely to learn these features despite differences in architecture and many other factors related to optimization and data. Discrete optimization and automatic prompt tuning A primary challenge of adversarial attacks in the setting of NLP models is that, unlike image inputs, text is inherently discrete, making it more difficult to leverage gradient-based optimization to construct adversarial attacks. However, there has been some amount of work on discrete optimization for such automatic prompt tuning methods, typically attempting to leverage the fact that other than the discrete nature of token inputs, the entire remainder of a deep-network-based LLM is a differentiable function. Generally speaking, there have been two primary approaches for prompt optimization. The first of these, embedding-based optimization, leverages the fact that the first layer in an LLM typically projects discrete tokens in some continuous embedding space, and that the the predicted probabilities over next tokens are a differentiable function over this embedding space. This immediately motivates the use of continuous optimization over the token embeddings, a technique often referred to as soft prompting [Lester et al., 2021]; indeed, anecdotally we find that constructing adversarial attacks over soft prompts is a relatively trivial process. Unfortunately, the challenge is that the process is not reversible: optimized soft prompts will typically have no corresponding discrete tokenization, and public-facing LLM interfaces do not typically allow users to provide continuous embeddings. However, there exist approaches that leverage these continuous embeddings by continually projecting onto hard token assignments. The Prompts Made Easy (PEZ) algorithm [Wen et al., 2023], for instance, uses a quantized optimization approach to adjust a continous embedding via gradients taken at projected points, then additionally projects the final solution back into the hard prompt space. Alternatively, recent work also leverages Langevin dynamics sampling to sample from discrete prompts while leveraging continuous embeddings [Qin et al., 2022]. An alternative set of approaches have instead largely optimized directly over discrete tokens in the first place. This includes work that has looked at greedy exhaustive search over tokens, which we find can typically perform well, but is also a computationally impractical in most settings. Alternatively, a number of approaches compute the gradient with respect to a one-hot encoding of the current token assignment: this essentially treats the one-hot vector as if it were a continuous quantity, to derive the relevant importance of this term. This approach was first used in the 19 HotFlip [Ebrahimi et al., 2017] methods, which always greedily replaced a single token with the alternative with the highest (negative) gradient. However, because gradients at the one-hot level may not accurately reflect the function after switching an entire token, the AutoPrompt [Shin et al., 2020] approach improved upon this by instead evaluating several possible token substitutions in the forward pass according to the k-largest negative gradients. Finally, the ARCA method [Jones et al., 2023] improved upon this further by also evaluating the approximate one-hot gradients at several potential token swaps, not just at the original one-hot encoding of the current token. Indeed, our own optimization approach follows this token-level gradient approach, with minor adjustments to the AutoPrompt method. 5 Conclusion and Future Work Despite the extensive literature on adversarial examples over the past decade, relatively little progress has been made at constructing reliable NLP attacks to circumvent the alignment training of modern language models. Indeed, most existing attacks have explicitly failed when evaluated on this problem. This paper leverages a simple approach, which largely employs (slight modifications of) a collection of techniques that had been previously considered in the literature in different forms. Yet from an applied standpoint it seems that this is enough to substantially push forward the state of the art is practical attacks against LLMs. Many questions and future work remain in this line of research. Perhaps the most natural question to ask is whether or not, given these attacks, models can be explicitly finetuned to avoid them. This is indeed precisely the strategy of adversarial training, still proven to be the empirically most effective means of training robust machine learning models: during training or finetuning of a model, we would attack it with one of these methods, then iteratively train on the “correct” response to the potentially-harmful query (while likely also training on additional non-potentiallyharmful queries). Will this process eventually lead to models that are not succeptible to such attacks (or slight modifications such as increasing the number of attack iterations)? Will they be able to prove robust while maintaining their high generative capabilities (this is decidedly not the case for classical ML models)? Will simply more amounts of “standard” alignment training already partially solve the problem? And finally, are there other mechanisms that can be brought to bear in the pre-training itself, to avoid such behavior in the first place? 6 Ethics and Broader Impact This research contains material that could allow people to generate harmful content from some public LLMs. Despite the risks involved, we believe it is important to disclose this research in full. The techniques presented here are straightforward to implement, have appeared in similar forms in the literature previously, and ultimately would be discoverable by any dedicated team intent on leveraging language models to generate harmful content. As several (manual) ”jailbreaks” of existing LLMs are already widely disseminated, the direct incremental harm caused by releasing our attacks is small for the time being. However, LLMs are more widely adopted, including moving towards systems that take autonomous actions based on LLMs, we believe that the potential risks will grow. We thus hope that this research can help to clarify the dangers that automated attacks pose to LLMs, and to highlight the trade-offs and risks involved in such systems. Prior to publication, we disclosed the results of this study to the organizations hosting the large closed-sourced LLMs we studied; accordingly, the examples shown in the paper will likely cease to 20 function. However, it remains unclear how the underlying challenge posed by our attack can be adequately addressed (if at all), or whether the presence of these attacks should limit the situations in which LLMs are applicable. We hope that our work will spur future research in these directions."

"For a band that broke up more than 50 years ago, The Beatles have put out a surprising amount of material in recent times.   Less than a year on from the buzz and hype of Peter Jackson's eight-hour-long doco The Beatles: Get Back and its accompanying expanded version of the album Let It Be, another ""new"" release from the long-gone band popped into stores and music streaming services this week.  The band's hugely influential seventh record Revolver is the latest Beatles album to get the super deluxe re-release treatment in the past five years, following on from souped-up versions of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, The Beatles (AKA The White Album), Abbey Road and Let It Be.  The Beatles band playing in front of a rainbow-coloured backdrop.

Tomorrow never knows The re-releases started with the 50th anniversary of the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 2017.  The main selling point for hardcore Beatles fans was the new stereo remix … and stick with me here, because we're heading into the borderlands of audiophile territory.  When the band and their producer George Martin recorded Sgt. Pepper's back in late 1966/early 1967, mono mixes were all the rage, and stereo mixes hadn't really caught on.  A black and white photo of George Harrison, Paul McCartney and John Lennon and producer George Martin in a studio. George Harrison, Paul McCartney, George Martin and John Lennon in the studio, circa 1965.(Supplied: Wikipedia Commons) Mono mixes were meant for sound systems with a single speaker, where all the individual instruments sound like they come from one point.  Stereo mixes split the sound across a left and right speaker, with the different instruments sounding like they're occupying a slightly different space, or sometimes even moving from left to right, as is the case in things like Queen's Now I'm Here, where Freddy Mercury's voice is initially in the left side of the mix, or the left speaker, and then the right.  The mid-1960s-thinking that mono was superior to stereo was borne out by the fact all four Beatles members were in the studio when the mono mix for Sgt. Pepper's was done, but didn't bother to hang around for the stereo mix — it was considered an after-thought to appease a select group of people who thought having two speakers was better than one.

Pepper's album.(Supplied: EMI) Nowadays, stereo mixes are industry standard, while mono mixes have gone the way of the Walkman.  Which brings us back to the re-release of Sgt. Pepper's, which saw original producer George Martin's son Giles inherit both his father's legacy and his seat at the mixing desk.  Giles was given the original four-track tapes of Sgt. Pepper's to do a new stereo mix of the landmark album, and while The Beatles still weren't in the studio for it, the result is one that benefits from 50 years of advances in mixing techniques and technology.  An picture of the master tape of A Day in the Life with recording details on the cover.

Even to untrained ears, the new mix is a vast improvement on the one from 1967. Instruments are balanced evenly across the mix, Ringo's drums and Paul's bass stand taller than before, and the vocals are richer and clearer.  While some die-hards still swear by the original mono mixes, there was a lot of love for the new stereo mix among the band's fan community.  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band Album cover In 2012 Rolling Stone magazine named Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band the greatest album of all time.(Supplied: flickr.com/Alberto Garrido/All Creative Commons) The album's re-release even went to number one on the UK charts and put Sgt. Pepper's back in the top five in dozens of countries, including Australia and the US.  New stereo mixes of The Beatles (AKA The White Album), Abbey Road and Let It Be soon followed, to an equally positive response.  Which brings us to Revolver.  Got to get you into my life Widely regarded as one of the most important albums of all time, Revolver saw The Beatles help revolutionise psychedelic and electronic music, while also pulling world music, classical, Motown and chamber music influences into mainstream pop.  The Beatles stand in a garden miming to a backing track on their guitars. A still from the film clip for Paperback Writer, which was released just ahead of Revolver and features on the album re-release.(Supplied: YouTube/The Beatles) To do this they pushed the recording studio to its limits, doing a remarkable amount with just a four-track recording machine — the pinnacle of recording technology in 1966.  But that same four-track technology has its own limitations, which initially made the idea of a Giles Martin stereo remix impossible, or at the very least, pointless.  On a song such as album-opener Taxman, the drums, bass and guitars are all on the same quarter of the four-track tape, unable to be separated, meaning there's very little that can be done with them to improve, for example, the guitar sound, without affecting the drum sound.  Space to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down arrows for volume. LISTEN Duration: 1 hour1h  Giles Martin talks to Andrew Ford about the Beatles album that is perhaps their single greatest collection of songs. But during the making of The Beatles: Get Back, director Peter Jackson and his boffins advanced technology that could separate the dialogue of The Beatles from the instruments they were banging away on while talking.  With some more improvements, including using AI developed by police to isolate voices in surveillance recordings, the technology got to the point where it could separate the drums, bass and guitars on Taxman, despite them being baked onto the same quarter of a four-track tape more than 50 years ago.  It means that Revolver, which bears an often ugly stereo mix, can get a more modern mix that many fans hope will do an amazing things to an already amazing album.  And your bird can sing If you're not interested in new mixes because you're happy with your old LPs/tapes/CDs or you're one of those people who listens to music out of the speaker in your phone, then the other sweetener in these so-called ""super deluxe"" re-releases is the bonus tracks.  While the promise of long-lost Beatles recordings might sound great, the vast majority are alternate takes of existing songs, often accompanied by bits of the band talking, which serve as a kind of historical document, but not something you would listen to in place of the real album.

For Sgt. Pepper's, it was the band-only takes of the songs, stripped of their psychedelic overdubs, showcasing the musicianship and songwriting at the core of the landmark album.  For The White Album, it was the ""Esher demos"" — all 27 of the joyful rough sketches the band laid down on acoustic guitars and percussion at George Harrison's place prior to getting into the studio, including eight tracks that didn't make this album.  For Abbey Road, it was hearing the construction of the individual songs that make up the medley, which comprises almost the entirety of the original record's side B.  The iconic album cover of Abbey Road by the Beatles Despite tensions within the group, The Beatles kept it together long enough to make Abbey Road, released in 1969.(Supplied: Apple Corps) For Let It Be, it was the many-and-varied jam sessions and musical diversions the band made while slowly falling apart, plus the unreleased mix of the album by original producer Glyn Johns.  For Revolver, there wasn't as much material left on the cutting-room floor, but the super deluxe edition features two discs worth of alternate takes and a couple of early demos.  Some will argue it sounds like the scraping of the bottom of the barrel, while others will marvel at the sound of a young band creating history in the prime of their musical lives.  Either way, it more than likely means a super deluxe remix edition of their 1965 opus Rubber Soul is just around the corner. "

https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/09/16/1199924303/chatgpt-ai-medical-advice	'Dr. Google' meets its match in Dr. ChatGPT	"As a fourth-year ophthalmology resident at Emory University School of Medicine, Riley Lyons' biggest responsibilities include triage: When a patient comes in with an eye-related complaint, Lyons must make an immediate assessment of its urgency.  He often finds patients have already turned to ""Dr. Google."" Online, Lyons said, they are likely to find that ""any number of terrible things could be going on based on the symptoms that they're experiencing.""  So, when two of Lyons' fellow ophthalmologists at Emory came to him and suggested evaluating the accuracy of the AI chatbot ChatGPT in diagnosing eye-related complaints, he jumped at the chance.  In June, Lyons and his colleagues reported in medRxiv, an online publisher of health science preprints, that ChatGPT compared quite well to human doctors who reviewed the same symptoms — and performed vastly better than the symptom checker on the popular health website WebMD.  And despite the much-publicized ""hallucination"" problem known to afflict ChatGPT — its habit of occasionally making outright false statements — the Emory study reported that the most recent version of ChatGPT made zero ""grossly inaccurate"" statements when presented with a standard set of eye complaints.  Doctors are drowning in paperwork. Some companies claim AI can help SHOTS - HEALTH NEWS Doctors are drowning in paperwork. Some companies claim AI can help The relative proficiency of ChatGPT, which debuted in November 2022, was a surprise to Lyons and his co-authors. The artificial intelligence engine ""is definitely an improvement over just putting something into a Google search bar and seeing what you find,"" said co-author Nieraj Jain, an assistant professor at the Emory Eye Center who specializes in vitreoretinal surgery and disease.  Filling in gaps in care with AI But the findings underscore a challenge facing the health care industry as it assesses the promise and pitfalls of generative AI, the type of artificial intelligence used by ChatGPT.  The accuracy of chatbot-delivered medical information may represent an improvement over Dr. Google, but there are still many questions about how to integrate this new technology into health care systems with the same safeguards historically applied to the introduction of new drugs or medical devices.  The smooth syntax, authoritative tone, and dexterity of generative AI have drawn extraordinary attention from all sectors of society, with some comparing its future impact to that of the internet itself. In health care, companies are working feverishly to implement generative AI in areas such as radiology and medical records.  AI in medicine needs to be carefully deployed to counter bias – and not entrench it SHOTS - HEALTH NEWS AI in medicine needs to be carefully deployed to counter bias – and not entrench it When it comes to consumer chatbots, though, there is still caution, even though the technology is already widely available — and better than many alternatives. Many doctors believe AI-based medical tools should undergo an approval process similar to the FDA's regime for drugs, but that would be years away. It's unclear how such a regime might apply to general-purpose AIs like ChatGPT.  ""There's no question we have issues with access to care, and whether or not it is a good idea to deploy ChatGPT to cover the holes or fill the gaps in access, it's going to happen and it's happening already,"" said Jain. ""People have already discovered its utility. So, we need to understand the potential advantages and the pitfalls.""  Bots with good bedside manner The Emory study is not alone in ratifying the relative accuracy of the new generation of AI chatbots. A report published in Nature in early July by a group led by Google computer scientists said answers generated by Med-PaLM, an AI chatbot the company built specifically for medical use, ""compare favorably with answers given by clinicians.""  AI may also have better bedside manner. Another study, published in April by researchers from the University of California-San Diego and other institutions, even noted that health care professionals rated ChatGPT answers as more empathetic than responses from human doctors.  Indeed, a number of companies are exploring how chatbots could be used for mental health therapy, and some investors in the companies are betting that healthy people might also enjoy chatting and even bonding with an AI ""friend."" The company behind Replika, one of the most advanced of that genre, markets its chatbot as, ""The AI companion who cares. Always here to listen and talk. Always on your side.""  ""We need physicians to start realizing that these new tools are here to stay and they're offering new capabilities both to physicians and patients,"" said James Benoit, an AI consultant.  While a postdoctoral fellow in nursing at the University of Alberta in Canada, Benoit published a study in February reporting that ChatGPT significantly outperformed online symptom checkers in evaluating a set of medical scenarios. ""They are accurate enough at this point to start meriting some consideration,"" he said.  An invitation to trouble Still, even the researchers who have demonstrated ChatGPT's relative reliability are cautious about recommending that patients put their full trust in the current state of AI. For many medical professionals, AI chatbots are an invitation to trouble: They cite a host of issues relating to privacy, safety, bias, liability, transparency, and the current absence of regulatory oversight.  The proposition that AI should be embraced because it represents a marginal improvement over Dr. Google is unconvincing, these critics say.  ""That's a little bit of a disappointing bar to set, isn't it?"" said Mason Marks, a professor and MD who specializes in health law at Florida State University. He recently wrote an opinion piece on AI chatbots and privacy in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  ""I don't know how helpful it is to say, 'Well, let's just throw this conversational AI on as a band-aid to make up for these deeper systemic issues,'"" he said to KFF Health News.  The biggest danger, in his view, is the likelihood that market incentives will result in AI interfaces designed to steer patients to particular drugs or medical services. ""Companies might want to push a particular product over another,"" said Marks. ""The potential for exploitation of people and the commercialization of data is unprecedented.""  OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT, also urged caution.  ""OpenAI's models are not fine-tuned to provide medical information,"" a company spokesperson said. ""You should never use our models to provide diagnostic or treatment services for serious medical conditions.""  John Ayers, a computational epidemiologist who was the lead author of the UCSD study, said that as with other medical interventions, the focus should be on patient outcomes.  ""If regulators came out and said that if you want to provide patient services using a chatbot, you have to demonstrate that chatbots improve patient outcomes, then randomized controlled trials would be registered tomorrow for a host of outcomes,"" Ayers said.  He would like to see a more urgent stance from regulators.  ""One hundred million people have ChatGPT on their phone,"" said Ayers, ""and are asking questions right now. People are going to use chatbots with or without us.""  At present, though, there are few signs that rigorous testing of AIs for safety and effectiveness is imminent. In May, Robert Califf, the commissioner of the FDA, described ""the regulation of large language models as critical to our future,"" but aside from recommending that regulators be ""nimble"" in their approach, he offered few details.  In the meantime, the race is on. In July, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Mayo Clinic was partnering with Google to integrate the Med-PaLM 2 chatbot into its system. In June, WebMD announced it was partnering with a Pasadena, California-based startup, HIA Technologies Inc., to provide interactive ""digital health assistants.""  And the ongoing integration of AI into both Microsoft's Bing and Google Search suggests that Dr. Google is already well on its way to being replaced by Dr. Chatbot."
https://thechainsaw.com/business/ai-for-dogs-bot-trains-and-entertains-your-dog-by-firing-treats/#:~:text=The%20Companion	An AI-Powered Robot That Can Train Your Dog Is Hitting The Market	AI is helping us in so many new ways these days so our obsession with it is understandable. But now our floofy companions may also be potential customers. A new dog-training AI robot is about to hit the market, after the beta version was well received. This AI can not only train our dogs for us, but it can keep them entertained when we are not there. That is the promise, anyway. Is this a dystopian nightmare where we lose our emotional connection with our pets? Or is it the breakthrough that is needed so we stop worrying about our pets while we aren’t there?  The device  Called Companion, the device is still in the early stages of life. After a successful initial beta release, it will now be available for mass consumption. This however is if you can get through the waiting list to buy it. Due for delivery in May of 2024, you might get lucky if you put your name down now.  Already, influencers have been recruited to try it out with their floofs.   AI Dog Training The Companion bot claims to be an autonomous dog training device that uses lights, sound, a camera, and a treat launcher in conjunction with AI processing. The aim is to compete with dog trainers or save you the work of pet training.    When the lights come on, the pup will know it is time to interact. The use of treats teaches the dog which behaviours are desirable.  While bots that give treats and train dogs are not new, there are some really interesting AI functions on the Companion that are new.   For example, the company promises regular software updates, and cloud-based storage that you will need to personalise the experience for your dog. The fees will also cover updates of the AI that will recognise health changes in your dog that can indicate problems, like a change of gait.  AI for dogs AI for dogs: The artificial intelligence in the bot can recognise health information. There are some costs attached though. There is the initial outlay of US$999 (AU$1495) for the actual device, plus there is a subscription per month of US$49 (AU$73).  The company making the bot says the main thrust of the AI is teaching with positive reinforcement. “We’re basically rewarding our furry friends for doing something we like. It could be a tasty treat for sitting like a champ, or a gentle scratch behind the ears each time they rest their head on our lap.”  AI for dogs The AI promises to tell owners how many calories the pup has consumed while getting all treated up. Expert opinion The founder of Animal Behaviour Experts, Rose Horton, says that there are some things that can’t be replaced with AI, like the love between a pet and an owner.  “When it comes to training dogs, you really need to be able to read the dog’s body language and then the dog needs to be picking up cues from a human.”  Horton says that if the robot was in the shape of a human, that would not be a good thing, as it would be too confusing for the dog. But other than that it holds promise. “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with using it, if your dog is left at home alone. It does stimulate the dog and keep it happy.”  This is as long as there isn’t a missing human relationship with the dog. “We steer people away from sending their dog out to get trained, because the training session should be with the owner and the dog, so that they can build a bond. As long as people don’t think it’s the cure for not training your dog and not taking it for a walk and other types of enrichment. I don’t think you can ever get anything to replace the human-animal bond. Training is so important for building the relationship with the dog and you would hope that people would never replace that.”   Human connection Animal Welfare League Queensland (AWLQ) is intrigued by the possibilities of the Companion AI system. “We believe in the principle that technology should serve to enhance our lives and those of our pets. As such, we appreciate the potential benefits that Companion could offer, such as increased mental stimulation and consistent positive reinforcement training for our furry family members. However, it is crucial to stress that this technology should serve as a supplement, rather than a replacement, for the vital and irreplaceable human-pet interaction. Dogs are pack animals; human companionship, physical touch, and social interaction are fundamental to their well-being. Technology, while potentially enriching our dogs’ lives, can never fully replicate the emotional connection and bond between a pet and their family.”  AWLQ says that Companion’s ability to track and monitor subtle behavioural changes could be a valuable tool in proactive pet health care, it is also vital to understand that behavioural issues are often complex and multifaceted. “Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach that includes understanding the root causes, providing appropriate training, and adjusting the environment. No technology can replace the understanding and empathy of a skilled animal behaviourist or a caring family.”  Big names Horton says that the device has very reputable names behind it. “Ken Ramirez is one of the top trainers in the world. And they’ve got a veterinary behaviourist Dr Marty Becker. These people are experts in their field. So if they’ve signed off on it, then I’d probably endorse it too.”   Horton also says that because it doesn’t punish the dog, and it provides mental enrichment, she feels like she can support it. “Separation anxiety is very common with dogs that are very popular at the moment, which is poodle crosses, like cavoodles. Anything that can help a dog feel more relaxed when it’s at home is good. But some things just can’t be replaced with AI and that’s of course the love between dog and owner. There’s absolutely no replacing that.”

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-generative-ai-job-exposure/	How the AI revolution is different: It threatens white-collar workers	"The emergence of artificial intelligence like ChatGPT has aroused fears of these tools replacing people in a range of professions, from coders to truck drivers. Although such concerns tend to ignore technology's potential to create jobs, new forms of AI do pose a risk to some workers, new research from Indeed suggests: white-collar workers.  ""Surprisingly enough, knowledge workers are facing the highest level of exposure here, which is quite different with what we've seen with other revolutions,"" Gudell said. ""With automation, often it was manual labor that was replaced,"" Svenja Gudell, chief economist at the job-search platform, told CBS MoneyWatch.   Unlike previous cycles of technical innovation, in-person, often low-wage jobs that rely heavily on humans being physically present are likely to be the the most resilient to encroaching AI, she added.  ""Driving cars still currently takes a person. Or child care. We probably wouldn't give our kids over to the robots quite yet,"" she said. Gudell added that ""We'll see the destruction of some jobs but also the creation of others along way. The human element still carries a lot of weight in these jobs — you really can't do without it.""  What jobs are most at risk? Among the openings currently on Indeed, software and coding jobs are the most exposed to replacement by AI, the firm found in a its analysis. That's because so-called generative AI was determined to be adept at performing 95% of the skills these jobs require.   In addition to software development, information technology, mathematics, information design, legal and accounting positions are also among the more exposed professions.  By contrast, truck and taxi driver jobs are least exposed to AI, which could only adequately perform about 30% of the necessary skills, according to Indeed. Other jobs that are relatively insulated against AI include cleaning and sanitation as well as beauty and wellness jobs, in part because they are least likely to be performed remotely.    Another key takeway, according to Indeed: The more suitable a job is to remote work, the higher its potential exposure is to generative AI-driven change.   ""A lot of in-person jobs heavily rely on that human element. You might mix in parts of generative AI there, but at the end of the day a nurse still needs to be present to stick the needle in the patient's arm to draw blood. With sales reps, a lot of in-person communication happens when talking to clients,"" Gudell said.  To be sure, AI is unlikely ever to fully replace humans even in areas where the technology excels. But it may supplant some workers whose jobs are rote and who don't employ AI to make them more productive.   ""It could mean you as an employee can use these tools and focus on higher productivity-level skills on the job. From the employer perspective, instead of hiring 15 copy editors, you might employ five because generative AI carries the load,"" Gudell said.   Of all the vacant positions on its platform, Indeed said that 20% are highly exposed to generative AI. Just over 45% are moderately exposed, and 35% are minimally exposed, the firm found.  Still, it is likely premature for workers in highly exposed occupations to overhaul their careers based solely on the potential threat of AI, according to Indeed.   ""It's too early to switch to another job because we are still in the beginning days of this technological advancement,"" Gudell said. ""We will see what it means for jobs of the future, to see how it will be translated to everyday actions on job."""
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/08/230823122530.htm	How artificial intelligence gave a paralyzed woman her voice back	"Researchers at UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley have developed a brain-computer interface (BCI) that has enabled a woman with severe paralysis from a brainstem stroke to speak through a digital avatar.  It is the first time that either speech or facial expressions have been synthesized from brain signals. The system can also decode these signals into text at nearly 80 words per minute, a vast improvement over commercially available technology.  Edward Chang, MD, chair of neurological surgery at UCSF, who has worked on the technology, known as a brain computer interface, or BCI, for more than a decade, hopes this latest research breakthrough, appearing Aug. 23, 2023, in Nature, will lead to an FDA-approved system that enables speech from brain signals in the near future.  ""Our goal is to restore a full, embodied way of communicating, which is really the most natural way for us to talk with others,"" said Chang, who is a member of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neuroscience and the Jeanne Robertson Distinguished Professor in Psychiatry. ""These advancements bring us much closer to making this a real solution for patients.""  Chang's team previously demonstrated it was possible to decode brain signals into text in a man who had also experienced a brainstem stroke many years earlier. The current study demonstrates something more ambitious: decoding brain signals into the richness of speech, along with the movements that animate a person's face during conversation.  Chang implanted a paper-thin rectangle of 253 electrodes onto the surface of the woman's brain over areas his team has discovered are critical for speech. The electrodes intercepted the brain signals that, if not for the stroke, would have gone to muscles in her, tongue, jaw and larynx, as well as her face. A cable, plugged into a port fixed to her head, connected the electrodes to a bank of computers.  For weeks, the participant worked with the team to train the system's artificial intelligence algorithms to recognize her unique brain signals for speech. This involved repeating different phrases from a 1,024-word conversational vocabulary over and over again, until the computer recognized the brain activity patterns associated with the sounds.  Rather than train the AI to recognize whole words, the researchers created a system that decodes words from phonemes. These are the sub-units of speech that form spoken words in the same way that letters form written words. ""Hello,"" for example, contains four phonemes: ""HH,"" ""AH,"" ""L"" and ""OW.""  Using this approach, the computer only needed to learn 39 phonemes to decipher any word in English. This both enhanced the system's accuracy and made it three times faster.  ""The accuracy, speed and vocabulary are crucial,"" said Sean Metzger, who developed the text decoder with Alex Silva, both graduate students in the joint Bioengineering Program at UC Berkeley and UCSF. ""It's what gives a user the potential, in time, to communicate almost as fast as we do, and to have much more naturalistic and normal conversations.""  To create the voice, the team devised an algorithm for synthesizing speech, which they personalized to sound like her voice before the injury, using a recording of her speaking at her wedding.  The team animated the avatar with the help of software that simulates and animates muscle movements of the face, developed by Speech Graphics, a company that makes AI-driven facial animation. The researchers created customized machine-learning processes that allowed the company's software to mesh with signals being sent from the woman's brain as she was trying to speak and convert them into the movements on the avatar's face, making the jaw open and close, the lips protrude and purse and the tongue go up and down, as well as the facial movements for happiness, sadness and surprise.  ""We're making up for the connections between the brain and vocal tract that have been severed by the stroke,"" said Kaylo Littlejohn, a graduate student working with Chang and Gopala Anumanchipalli, PhD, a professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley. ""When the subject first used this system to speak and move the avatar's face in tandem, I knew that this was going to be something that would have a real impact.""  An important next step for the team is to create a wireless version that would not require the user to be physically connected to the BCI.  ""Giving people the ability to freely control their own computers and phones with this technology would have profound effects on their independence and social interactions,"" said co-first author David Moses, PhD, an adjunct professor in neurological surgery."

https://paperswithcode.com/paper/wave-u-net-a-multi-scale-neural-network-for	Wave-U-Net: A Multi-Scale Neural Network for End-to-End Audio Source Separation	Models for audio source separation usually operate on the magnitude spectrum, which ignores phase information and makes separation performance dependant on hyper-parameters for the spectral front-end. Therefore, we investigate end-to-end source separation in the time-domain, which allows modelling phase information and avoids fixed spectral transformations. Due to high sampling rates for audio, employing a long temporal input context on the sample level is difficult, but required for high quality separation results because of long-range temporal correlations. In this context, we propose the Wave-U-Net, an adaptation of the U-Net to the one-dimensional time domain, which repeatedly resamples feature maps to compute and combine features at different time scales. We introduce further architectural improvements, including an output layer that enforces source additivity, an upsampling technique and a context-aware prediction framework to reduce output artifacts. Experiments for singing voice separation indicate that our architecture yields a performance comparable to a state-of-the-art spectrogram-based U-Net architecture, given the same data. Finally, we reveal a problem with outliers in the currently used SDR evaluation metrics and suggest reporting rank-based statistics to alleviate this problem.
